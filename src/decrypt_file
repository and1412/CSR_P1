ONE CAN IMAGINE WHAT KIND OF THOUGHTS SUCH A PROSPECT AWAKENED IN THE
MIND OF A YOUNG FELLOW WHO WAS BY NO MEANS WHAT IS CALLED A 'GOOD BOY'
IN THE CURRENT SENSE OF THAT TERM. THE RIDICULOUSLY EASY SCHOOL TASKS
WHICH WE WERE GIVEN MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO SPEND FAR MORE TIME IN
THE OPEN AIR THAN AT HOME. TO-DAY, WHEN MY POLITICAL OPPONENTS PRY INTO
MY LIFE WITH DILIGENT SCRUTINY, AS FAR BACK AS THE DAYS OF MY BOYHOOD,
SO AS FINALLY TO BE ABLE TO PROVE WHAT DISREPUTABLE TRICKS THIS HITLER
WAS ACCUSTOMED TO IN HIS YOUNG DAYS, I THANK HEAVEN THAT I CAN LOOK BACK
TO THOSE HAPPY DAYS AND FIND THE MEMORY OF THEM HELPFUL. THE FIELDS AND
THE WOODS WERE THEN THE TERRAIN ON WHICH ALL DISPUTES WERE FOUGHT OUT.

EVEN ATTENDANCE AT THE REALSCHULE COULD NOT ALTER MY WAY OF SPENDING MY
TIME. BUT I HAD NOW ANOTHER BATTLE TO FIGHT.

SO LONG AS THE PATERNAL PLAN TO MAKE A STATE FUNCTIONARY CONTRADICTED MY
OWN INCLINATIONS ONLY IN THE ABSTRACT, THE CONFLICT WAS EASY TO BEAR. I
COULD BE DISCREET ABOUT EXPRESSING MY PERSONAL VIEWS AND THUS AVOID
CONSTANTLY RECURRENT DISPUTES. MY OWN RESOLUTION NOT TO BECOME A
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE TIME BEING TO PUT MY MIND
COMPLETELY AT REST. I HELD ON TO THAT RESOLUTION INEXORABLY. BUT THE
SITUATION BECAME MORE DIFFICULT ONCE I HAD A POSITIVE PLAN OF MY OWN
WHICH I MIGHT PRESENT TO MY FATHER AS A COUNTER-SUGGESTION. THIS
HAPPENED WHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD. HOW IT CAME ABOUT I CANNOT EXACTLY
SAY NOW; BUT ONE DAY IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT I WOULD BE A PAINTER--I
MEAN AN ARTIST. THAT I HAD AN APTITUDE FOR DRAWING WAS AN ADMITTED FACT.
IT WAS EVEN ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MY FATHER HAD SENT ME TO THE
REALSCHULE; BUT HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF HAVING THAT TALENT DEVELOPED IN
SUCH A WAY THAT I COULD TAKE UP PAINTING AS A PROFESSIONAL CAREER. QUITE
THE CONTRARY. WHEN, AS A RESULT OF MY RENEWED REFUSAL TO ADOPT HIS
FAVOURITE PLAN, MY FATHER ASKED ME FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT I MYSELF
REALLY WISHED TO BE, THE RESOLUTION THAT I HAD ALREADY FORMED EXPRESSED
ITSELF ALMOST AUTOMATICALLY. FOR A WHILE MY FATHER WAS SPEECHLESS. "A
PAINTER? AN ARTIST-PAINTER?" HE EXCLAIMED.

HE WONDERED WHETHER I WAS IN A SOUND STATE OF MIND. HE THOUGHT THAT HE
MIGHT NOT HAVE CAUGHT MY WORDS RIGHTLY, OR THAT HE HAD MISUNDERSTOOD
WHAT I MEANT. BUT WHEN I HAD EXPLAINED MY IDEAS TO HIM AND HE SAW HOW
SERIOUSLY I TOOK THEM, HE OPPOSED THEM WITH THAT FULL DETERMINATION
WHICH WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM. HIS DECISION WAS EXCEEDINGLY SIMPLE AND
COULD NOT BE DEFLECTED FROM ITS COURSE BY ANY CONSIDERATION OF WHAT MY
OWN NATURAL QUALIFICATIONS REALLY WERE.

"ARTIST! NOT AS LONG AS I LIVE, NEVER." AS THE SON HAD INHERITED SOME OF
THE FATHER'S OBSTINACY, BESIDES HAVING OTHER QUALITIES OF HIS OWN, MY
REPLY WAS EQUALLY ENERGETIC. BUT IT STATED SOMETHING QUITE THE CONTRARY.

AT THAT OUR STRUGGLE BECAME STALEMATE. THE FATHER WOULD NOT ABANDON HIS
'NEVER', AND I BECAME ALL THE MORE CONSOLIDATED IN MY 'NEVERTHELESS'.

NATURALLY THE RESULTING SITUATION WAS NOT PLEASANT. THE OLD GENTLEMAN
WAS BITTERLY ANNOYED; AND INDEED SO WAS I, ALTHOUGH I REALLY LOVED HIM.
MY FATHER FORBADE ME TO ENTERTAIN ANY HOPES OF TAKING UP THE ART OF
PAINTING AS A PROFESSION. I WENT A STEP FURTHER AND DECLARED THAT I
WOULD NOT STUDY ANYTHING ELSE. WITH SUCH DECLARATIONS THE SITUATION
BECAME STILL MORE STRAINED, SO THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN IRREVOCABLY
DECIDED TO ASSERT HIS PARENTAL AUTHORITY AT ALL COSTS. THAT LED ME TO
ADOPT AN ATTITUDE OF CIRCUMSPECT SILENCE, BUT I PUT MY THREAT INTO
EXECUTION. I THOUGHT THAT, ONCE IT BECAME CLEAR TO MY FATHER THAT I WAS
MAKING NO PROGRESS AT THE REALSCHULE, FOR WEAL OR FOR WOE, HE WOULD BE
FORCED TO ALLOW ME TO FOLLOW THE HAPPY CAREER I HAD DREAMED OF.

I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I CALCULATED RIGHTLY OR NOT. CERTAINLY MY FAILURE
TO MAKE PROGRESS BECAME QUITE VISIBLE IN THE SCHOOL. I STUDIED JUST THE
SUBJECTS THAT APPEALED TO ME, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH I THOUGHT MIGHT BE
OF ADVANTAGE TO ME LATER ON AS A PAINTER. WHAT DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE
ANY IMPORTANCE FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW, OR WHAT DID NOT OTHERWISE APPEAL
TO ME FAVOURABLY, I COMPLETELY SABOTAGED. MY SCHOOL REPORTS OF THAT TIME
WERE ALWAYS IN THE EXTREMES OF GOOD OR BAD, ACCORDING TO THE SUBJECT AND
THE INTEREST IT HAD FOR ME. IN ONE COLUMN MY QUALIFICATION READ 'VERY
GOOD' OR 'EXCELLENT'. IN ANOTHER IT READ 'AVERAGE' OR EVEN 'BELOW
AVERAGE'. BY FAR MY BEST SUBJECTS WERE GEOGRAPHY AND, EVEN MORE SO,
GENERAL HISTORY. THESE WERE MY TWO FAVOURITE SUBJECTS, AND I LED THE
CLASS IN THEM.

WHEN I LOOK BACK OVER SO MANY YEARS AND TRY TO JUDGE THE RESULTS OF THAT
EXPERIENCE I FIND TWO VERY SIGNIFICANT FACTS STANDING OUT CLEARLY BEFORE
MY MIND.

FIRST, I BECAME A NATIONALIST.

SECOND, I LEARNED TO UNDERSTAND AND GRASP THE TRUE MEANING OF HISTORY.

THE OLD AUSTRIA WAS A MULTI-NATIONAL STATE. IN THOSE DAYS AT LEAST THE
CITIZENS OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE, TAKEN THROUGH AND THROUGH, COULD NOT
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT FACT MEANT IN THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF THE INDIVIDUALS
WITHIN SUCH A STATE. AFTER THE MAGNIFICENT TRIUMPHANT MARCH OF THE
VICTORIOUS ARMIES IN THE FRANCO-GERMAN WAR THE GERMANS IN THE REICH
BECAME STEADILY MORE AND MORE ESTRANGED FROM THE GERMANS BEYOND THEIR
FRONTIERS, PARTLY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT DEIGN TO APPRECIATE THOSE OTHER
GERMANS AT THEIR TRUE VALUE OR SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE INCAPABLE OF
DOING SO.

THE GERMANS OF THE REICH DID NOT REALIZE THAT IF THE GERMANS IN AUSTRIA
HAD NOT BEEN OF THE BEST RACIAL STOCK THEY COULD NEVER HAVE GIVEN THE
STAMP OF THEIR OWN CHARACTER TO AN EMPIRE OF 52 MILLIONS, SO DEFINITELY
THAT IN GERMANY ITSELF THE IDEA AROSE--THOUGH QUITE AN ERRONEOUS
ONE--THAT AUSTRIA WAS A GERMAN STATE. THAT WAS AN ERROR WHICH LED TO
DIRE CONSEQUENCES; BUT ALL THE SAME IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT TESTIMONY TO
THE CHARACTER OF THE TEN MILLION GERMANS IN THAT EAST MARK. (NOTE 3)
ONLY VERY FEW OF THE GERMANS IN THE REICH ITSELF HAD AN IDEA OF THE BITTER
STRUGGLE WHICH THOSE EASTERN GERMANS HAD TO CARRY ON DAILY FOR THE
PRESERVATION OF THEIR GERMAN LANGUAGE, THEIR GERMAN SCHOOLS AND THEIR
GERMAN CHARACTER. ONLY TO-DAY, WHEN A TRAGIC FATE HAS TORN SEVERAL
MILLIONS OF OUR KINSFOLK AWAY FROM THE REICH AND HAS FORCED THEM TO LIVE
UNDER THE RULE OF THE STRANGER, DREAMING OF THAT COMMON FATHERLAND
TOWARDS WHICH ALL THEIR YEARNINGS ARE DIRECTED AND STRUGGLING TO UPHOLD
AT LEAST THE SACRED RIGHT OF USING THEIR MOTHER TONGUE--ONLY NOW HAVE
THE WIDER CIRCLES OF THE GERMAN POPULATION COME TO REALIZE WHAT IT MEANS
TO HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THE TRADITIONS OF ONE'S RACE. AND SO AT LAST
PERHAPS THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE AND THERE WHO CAN ASSESS THE GREATNESS OF
THAT GERMAN SPIRIT WHICH ANIMATED THE OLD EAST MARK AND ENABLED THOSE
PEOPLE, LEFT ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THEIR OWN RESOURCES, TO DEFEND THE
EMPIRE AGAINST THE ORIENT FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO HOLD
FAST THE FRONTIERS OF THE GERMAN LANGUAGE THROUGH A GUERILLA WARFARE OF
ATTRITION, AT A TIME WHEN THE GERMAN EMPIRE WAS SEDULOUSLY CULTIVATING
AN INTEREST FOR COLONIES BUT NOT FOR ITS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD BEFORE THE
THRESHOLD OF ITS OWN DOOR.

[NOTE 3. SEE TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION.]

WHAT HAS HAPPENED ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE, IN EVERY KIND OF STRUGGLE,
HAPPENED ALSO IN THE LANGUAGE FIGHT WHICH WAS CARRIED ON IN THE OLD
AUSTRIA. THERE WERE THREE GROUPS--THE FIGHTERS, THE HEDGERS AND THE
TRAITORS. EVEN IN THE SCHOOLS THIS SIFTING ALREADY BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE.
AND IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE STRUGGLE FOR THE LANGUAGE WAS WAGED
PERHAPS IN ITS BITTEREST FORM AROUND THE SCHOOL; BECAUSE THIS WAS THE
NURSERY WHERE THE SEEDS HAD TO BE WATERED WHICH WERE TO SPRING UP AND
FORM THE FUTURE GENERATION. THE TACTICAL OBJECTIVE OF THE FIGHT WAS THE
WINNING OVER OF THE CHILD, AND IT WAS TO THE CHILD THAT THE FIRST
RALLYING CRY WAS ADDRESSED:

"GERMAN YOUTH, DO NOT FORGET THAT YOU ARE A GERMAN," AND "REMEMBER,
LITTLE GIRL, THAT ONE DAY YOU MUST BE A GERMAN MOTHER."

THOSE WHO KNOW SOMETHING OF THE JUVENILE SPIRIT CAN UNDERSTAND HOW YOUTH
WILL ALWAYS LEND A GLAD EAR TO SUCH A RALLYING CRY. UNDER MANY FORMS THE
YOUNG PEOPLE LED THE STRUGGLE, FIGHTING IN THEIR OWN WAY AND WITH THEIR
OWN WEAPONS. THEY REFUSED TO SING NON-GERMAN SONGS. THE GREATER THE
EFFORTS MADE TO WIN THEM AWAY FROM THEIR GERMAN ALLEGIANCE, THE MORE
THEY EXALTED THE GLORY OF THEIR GERMAN HEROES. THEY STINTED THEMSELVES
IN BUYING THINGS TO EAT, SO THAT THEY MIGHT SPARE THEIR PENNIES TO HELP
THE WAR CHEST OF THEIR ELDERS. THEY WERE INCREDIBLY ALERT IN THE
SIGNIFICANCE OF WHAT THE NON-GERMAN TEACHERS SAID AND THEY CONTRADICTED
IN UNISON. THEY WORE THE FORBIDDEN EMBLEMS OF THEIR OWN KINSFOLK AND
WERE HAPPY WHEN PENALISED FOR DOING SO, OR EVEN PHYSICALLY PUNISHED. IN
MINIATURE THEY WERE MIRRORS OF LOYALTY FROM WHICH THE OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT
LEARN A LESSON.

AND THUS IT WAS THAT AT A COMPARATIVELY EARLY AGE I TOOK PART IN THE
STRUGGLE WHICH THE NATIONALITIES WERE WAGING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN THE
OLD AUSTRIA. WHEN MEETINGS WERE HELD FOR THE SOUTH MARK GERMAN LEAGUE
AND THE SCHOOL LEAGUE WE WORE CORNFLOWERS AND BLACK-RED-GOLD COLOURS TO
EXPRESS OUR LOYALTY. WE GREETED ONE ANOTHER WITH HEIL! AND INSTEAD OF
THE AUSTRIAN ANTHEM WE SANG OUR OWN DEUTSCHLAND ÃœBER ALLES, DESPITE
WARNINGS AND PENALTIES. THUS THE YOUTH WERE EDUCATED POLITICALLY AT A
TIME WHEN THE CITIZENS OF A SO-CALLED NATIONAL STATE FOR THE MOST PART
KNEW LITTLE OF THEIR OWN NATIONALITY EXCEPT THE LANGUAGE. OF COURSE, I
DID NOT BELONG TO THE HEDGERS. WITHIN A LITTLE WHILE I HAD BECOME AN
ARDENT 'GERMAN NATIONAL', WHICH HAS A DIFFERENT MEANING FROM THE PARTY
SIGNIFICANCE ATTACHED TO THAT PHRASE TO-DAY.

I DEVELOPED VERY RAPIDLY IN THE NATIONALIST DIRECTION, AND BY THE TIME I
WAS 15 YEARS OLD I HAD COME TO UNDERSTAND THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN
DYNASTIC PATRIOTISM AND NATIONALISM BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF FOLK, OR
PEOPLE, MY INCLINATION BEING ENTIRELY IN FAVOUR OF THE LATTER.

SUCH A PREFERENCE MAY NOT PERHAPS BE CLEARLY INTELLIGIBLE TO THOSE WHO
HAVE NEVER TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO STUDY THE INTERNAL CONDITIONS THAT
PREVAILED UNDER THE HABSBURG MONARCHY.

AMONG HISTORICAL STUDIES UNIVERSAL HISTORY WAS THE SUBJECT ALMOST
EXCLUSIVELY TAUGHT IN THE AUSTRIAN SCHOOLS, FOR OF SPECIFIC AUSTRIAN
HISTORY THERE WAS ONLY VERY LITTLE. THE FATE OF THIS STATE WAS CLOSELY
BOUND UP WITH THE EXISTENCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF GERMANY AS A WHOLE; SO A
DIVISION OF HISTORY INTO GERMAN HISTORY AND AUSTRIAN HISTORY WOULD BE
PRACTICALLY INCONCEIVABLE. AND INDEED IT WAS ONLY WHEN THE GERMAN PEOPLE
CAME TO BE DIVIDED BETWEEN TWO STATES THAT THIS DIVISION OF GERMAN
HISTORY BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE.

THE INSIGNIA (NOTE 4) OF A FORMER IMPERIAL SOVEREIGNTY WHICH WERE STILL
PRESERVED IN VIENNA APPEARED TO ACT AS MAGICAL RELICS RATHER THAN AS THE
VISIBLE GUARANTEE OF AN EVERLASTING BOND OF UNION.

[NOTE 4. WHEN FRANCIS II HAD LAID DOWN HIS TITLE AS EMPEROR OF THE HOLY
ROMAN EMPIREOF THE GERMAN NATION, WHICH HE DID AT THE COMMAND OF NAPOLEON,
THE CROWNAND MACE, AS THE IMPERIAL INSIGNIA, WERE KEPT IN VIENNA. AFTER
THE GERMAN EMPIRE WAS REFOUNDED, IN 1871, UNDER WILLIAM I, THERE WERE MANY
DEMANDS TOHAVE THE INSIGNIA TRANSFERRED TO BERLIN. BUT THESE WENT
UNHEEDED. HITLER HAD THEM BROUGHT TO GERMANY AFTER THE AUSTRIAN ANSCHLUSS
AND DISPLAYED AT NUREMBERG DURING THE PARTY CONGRESS IN SEPTEMBER 1938.]

WHEN THE HABSBURG STATE CRUMBLED TO PIECES IN 1918 THE AUSTRIAN GERMANS
INSTINCTIVELY RAISED AN OUTCRY FOR UNION WITH THEIR GERMAN FATHERLAND.
THAT WAS THE VOICE OF A UNANIMOUS YEARNING IN THE HEARTS OF THE WHOLE
PEOPLE FOR A RETURN TO THE UNFORGOTTEN HOME OF THEIR FATHERS. BUT SUCH A
GENERAL YEARNING COULD NOT BE EXPLAINED EXCEPT BY ATTRIBUTING THE CAUSE
OF IT TO THE HISTORICAL TRAINING THROUGH WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL AUSTRIAN
GERMANS HAD PASSED. THEREIN LAY A SPRING THAT NEVER DRIED UP. ESPECIALLY
IN TIMES OF DISTRACTION AND FORGETFULNESS ITS QUIET VOICE WAS A REMINDER
OF THE PAST, BIDDING THE PEOPLE TO LOOK OUT BEYOND THE MERE WELFARE OF
THE MOMENT TO A NEW FUTURE.

THE TEACHING OF UNIVERSAL HISTORY IN WHAT ARE CALLED THE MIDDLE SCHOOLS
IS STILL VERY UNSATISFACTORY. FEW TEACHERS REALIZE THAT THE PURPOSE OF
TEACHING HISTORY IS NOT THE MEMORIZING OF SOME DATES AND FACTS, THAT THE
STUDENT IS NOT INTERESTED IN KNOWING THE EXACT DATE OF A BATTLE OR THE
BIRTHDAY OF SOME MARSHAL OR OTHER, AND NOT AT ALL--OR AT LEAST ONLY VERY
INSIGNIFICANTLY--INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHEN THE CROWN OF HIS FATHERS WAS
PLACED ON THE BROW OF SOME MONARCH. THESE ARE CERTAINLY NOT LOOKED UPON
AS IMPORTANT MATTERS.

TO STUDY HISTORY MEANS TO SEARCH FOR AND DISCOVER THE FORCES THAT ARE
THE CAUSES OF THOSE RESULTS WHICH APPEAR BEFORE OUR EYES AS HISTORICAL
EVENTS. THE ART OF READING AND STUDYING CONSISTS IN REMEMBERING THE
ESSENTIALS AND FORGETTING WHAT IS NOT ESSENTIAL.

PROBABLY MY WHOLE FUTURE LIFE WAS DETERMINED BY THE FACT THAT I HAD A
PROFESSOR OF HISTORY WHO UNDERSTOOD, AS FEW OTHERS UNDERSTAND, HOW TO
MAKE THIS VIEWPOINT PREVAIL IN TEACHING AND IN EXAMINING. THIS TEACHER
WAS DR. LEOPOLD POETSCH, OF THE REALSCHULE AT LINZ. HE WAS THE IDEAL
PERSONIFICATION OF THE QUALITIES NECESSARY TO A TEACHER OF HISTORY IN
THE SENSE I HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE. AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WITH A DECISIVE
MANNER BUT A KINDLY HEART, HE WAS A VERY ATTRACTIVE SPEAKER AND WAS ABLE
TO INSPIRE US WITH HIS OWN ENTHUSIASM. EVEN TO-DAY I CANNOT RECALL
WITHOUT EMOTION THAT VENERABLE PERSONALITY WHOSE ENTHUSIASTIC EXPOSITION
OF HISTORY SO OFTEN MADE US ENTIRELY FORGET THE PRESENT AND ALLOW
OURSELVES TO BE TRANSPORTED AS IF BY MAGIC INTO THE PAST. HE PENETRATED
THROUGH THE DIM MIST OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND TRANSFORMED THE
HISTORICAL MEMORY OF THE DEAD PAST INTO A LIVING REALITY. WHEN WE
LISTENED TO HIM WE BECAME AFIRE WITH ENTHUSIASM AND WE WERE SOMETIMES
MOVED EVEN TO TEARS.

IT WAS STILL MORE FORTUNATE THAT THIS PROFESSOR WAS ABLE NOT ONLY TO
ILLUSTRATE THE PAST BY EXAMPLES FROM THE PRESENT BUT FROM THE PAST HE
WAS ALSO ABLE TO DRAW A LESSON FOR THE PRESENT. HE UNDERSTOOD BETTER
THAN ANY OTHER THE EVERYDAY PROBLEMS THAT WERE THEN AGITATING OUR MINDS.
THE NATIONAL FERVOUR WHICH WE FELT IN OUR OWN SMALL WAY WAS UTILIZED BY
HIM AS AN INSTRUMENT OF OUR EDUCATION, INASMUCH AS HE OFTEN APPEALED TO
OUR NATIONAL SENSE OF HONOUR; FOR IN THAT WAY HE MAINTAINED ORDER AND
HELD OUR ATTENTION MUCH MORE EASILY THAN HE COULD HAVE DONE BY ANY OTHER
MEANS. IT WAS BECAUSE I HAD SUCH A PROFESSOR THAT HISTORY BECAME MY
FAVOURITE SUBJECT. AS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE, BUT WITHOUT THE CONSCIOUS
CONNIVANCE OF MY PROFESSOR, I THEN AND THERE BECAME A YOUNG REBEL. BUT
WHO COULD HAVE STUDIED GERMAN HISTORY UNDER SUCH A TEACHER AND NOT
BECOME AN ENEMY OF THAT STATE WHOSE RULERS EXERCISED SUCH A DISASTROUS
INFLUENCE ON THE DESTINIES OF THE GERMAN NATION? FINALLY, HOW COULD ONE
REMAIN THE FAITHFUL SUBJECT OF THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG, WHOSE PAST HISTORY
AND PRESENT CONDUCT PROVED IT TO BE READY EVER AND ALWAYS TO BETRAY THE
INTERESTS OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE FOR THE SAKE OF PALTRY PERSONAL
INTERESTS? DID NOT WE AS YOUNGSTERS FULLY REALIZE THAT THE HOUSE OF
HABSBURG DID NOT, AND COULD NOT, HAVE ANY LOVE FOR US GERMANS?

WHAT HISTORY TAUGHT US ABOUT THE POLICY FOLLOWED BY THE HOUSE OF
HABSBURG WAS CORROBORATED BY OUR OWN EVERYDAY EXPERIENCES. IN THE NORTH
AND IN THE SOUTH THE POISON OF FOREIGN RACES WAS EATING INTO THE BODY OF
OUR PEOPLE, AND EVEN VIENNA WAS STEADILY BECOMING MORE AND MORE A
NON-GERMAN CITY. THE 'IMPERIAL HOUSE' FAVOURED THE CZECHS ON EVERY
POSSIBLE OCCASION. INDEED IT WAS THE HAND OF THE GODDESS OF ETERNAL
JUSTICE AND INEXORABLE RETRIBUTION THAT CAUSED THE MOST DEADLY ENEMY OF
GERMANISM IN AUSTRIA, THE ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND, TO FALL BY THE VERY
BULLETS WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD HELPED TO CAST. WORKING FROM ABOVE
DOWNWARDS, HE WAS THE CHIEF PATRON OF THE MOVEMENT TO MAKE AUSTRIA A
SLAV STATE.

THE BURDENS LAID ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE WERE ENORMOUS AND
THE SACRIFICES OF MONEY AND BLOOD WHICH THEY HAD TO MAKE WERE INCREDIBLY
HEAVY.

YET ANYBODY WHO WAS NOT QUITE BLIND MUST HAVE SEEN THAT IT WAS ALL IN
VAIN. WHAT AFFECTED US MOST BITTERLY WAS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE FACT
THAT THIS WHOLE SYSTEM WAS MORALLY SHIELDED BY THE ALLIANCE WITH
GERMANY, WHEREBY THE SLOW EXTIRPATION OF GERMANISM IN THE OLD AUSTRIAN
MONARCHY SEEMED IN SOME WAY TO BE MORE OR LESS SANCTIONED BY GERMANY
HERSELF. HABSBURG HYPOCRISY, WHICH ENDEAVOURED OUTWARDLY TO MAKE THE
PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT AUSTRIA STILL REMAINED A GERMAN STATE, INCREASED THE
FEELING OF HATRED AGAINST THE IMPERIAL HOUSE AND AT THE SAME TIME
AROUSED A SPIRIT OF REBELLION AND CONTEMPT.

BUT IN THE GERMAN EMPIRE ITSELF THOSE WHO WERE THEN ITS RULERS SAW
NOTHING OF WHAT ALL THIS MEANT. AS IF STRUCK BLIND, THEY STOOD BESIDE A
CORPSE AND IN THE VERY SYMPTOMS OF DECOMPOSITION THEY BELIEVED THAT THEY
RECOGNIZED THE SIGNS OF A RENEWED VITALITY. IN THAT UNHAPPY ALLIANCE
BETWEEN THE YOUNG GERMAN EMPIRE AND THE ILLUSORY AUSTRIAN STATE LAY THE
GERM OF THE WORLD WAR AND ALSO OF THE FINAL COLLAPSE.

IN THE SUBSEQUENT PAGES OF THIS BOOK I SHALL GO TO THE ROOT OF THE
PROBLEM. SUFFICE IT TO SAY HERE THAT IN THE VERY EARLY YEARS OF MY YOUTH
I CAME TO CERTAIN CONCLUSIONS WHICH I HAVE NEVER ABANDONED. INDEED I
BECAME MORE PROFOUNDLY CONVINCED OF THEM AS THE YEARS PASSED. THEY WERE:
THAT THE DISSOLUTION OF THE AUSTRIAN EMPIRE IS A PRELIMINARY CONDITION
FOR THE DEFENCE OF GERMANY; FURTHER, THAT NATIONAL FEELING IS BY NO
MEANS IDENTICAL WITH DYNASTIC PATRIOTISM; FINALLY, AND ABOVE ALL, THAT
THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG WAS DESTINED TO BRING MISFORTUNE TO THE GERMAN
NATION.

AS A LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OF THESE CONVICTIONS, THERE AROSE IN ME A
FEELING OF INTENSE LOVE FOR MY GERMAN-AUSTRIAN HOME AND A PROFOUND
HATRED FOR THE AUSTRIAN STATE.

THAT KIND OF HISTORICAL THINKING WHICH WAS DEVELOPED IN ME THROUGH MY
STUDY OF HISTORY AT SCHOOL NEVER LEFT ME AFTERWARDS. WORLD HISTORY
BECAME MORE AND MORE AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF
CONTEMPORARY HISTORICAL EVENTS, WHICH MEANS POLITICS. THEREFORE I WILL
NOT "LEARN" POLITICS BUT LET POLITICS TEACH ME.

A PRECOCIOUS REVOLUTIONARY IN POLITICS I WAS NO LESS A PRECOCIOUS
REVOLUTIONARY IN ART. AT THAT TIME THE PROVINCIAL CAPITAL OF UPPER
AUSTRIA HAD A THEATRE WHICH, RELATIVELY SPEAKING, WAS NOT BAD. ALMOST
EVERYTHING WAS PLAYED THERE. WHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD I SAW WILLIAM
TELL PERFORMED. THAT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF THE THEATRE. SOME MONTHS
LATER I ATTENDED A PERFORMANCE OF LOHENGRIN, THE FIRST OPERA I HAD EVER
HEARD. I WAS FASCINATED AT ONCE. MY YOUTHFUL ENTHUSIASM FOR THE BAYREUTH
MASTER KNEW NO LIMITS. AGAIN AND AGAIN I WAS DRAWN TO HEAR HIS OPERAS;
AND TO-DAY I CONSIDER IT A GREAT PIECE OF LUCK THAT THESE MODEST
PRODUCTIONS IN THE LITTLE PROVINCIAL CITY PREPARED THE WAY AND MADE IT
POSSIBLE FOR ME TO APPRECIATE THE BETTER PRODUCTIONS LATER ON.

BUT ALL THIS HELPED TO INTENSIFY MY PROFOUND AVERSION FOR THE CAREER
THAT MY FATHER HAD CHOSEN FOR ME; AND THIS DISLIKE BECAME ESPECIALLY
STRONG AS THE ROUGH CORNERS OF YOUTHFUL BOORISHNESS BECAME WORN OFF, A
PROCESS WHICH IN MY CASE CAUSED A GOOD DEAL OF PAIN. I BECAME MORE AND
MORE CONVINCED THAT I SHOULD NEVER BE HAPPY AS A STATE OFFICIAL. AND NOW
THAT THE REALSCHULE HAD RECOGNIZED AND ACKNOWLEDGED MY APTITUDE FOR
DRAWING, MY OWN RESOLUTION BECAME ALL THE STRONGER. IMPRECATIONS AND
THREATS HAD NO LONGER ANY CHANCE OF CHANGING IT. I WANTED TO BECOME A
PAINTER AND NO POWER IN THE WORLD COULD FORCE ME TO BECOME A CIVIL
SERVANT. THE ONLY PECULIAR FEATURE OF THE SITUATION NOW WAS THAT AS I
GREW BIGGER I BECAME MORE AND MORE INTERESTED IN ARCHITECTURE. I
CONSIDERED THIS FACT AS A NATURAL DEVELOPMENT OF MY FLAIR FOR PAINTING
AND I REJOICED INWARDLY THAT THE SPHERE OF MY ARTISTIC INTERESTS WAS
THUS ENLARGED. I HAD NO NOTION THAT ONE DAY IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
OTHERWISE.

THE QUESTION OF MY CAREER WAS DECIDED MUCH SOONER THAN I COULD HAVE
EXPECTED.

WHEN I WAS IN MY THIRTEENTH YEAR MY FATHER WAS SUDDENLY TAKEN FROM US.
HE WAS STILL IN ROBUST HEALTH WHEN A STROKE OF APOPLEXY PAINLESSLY ENDED
HIS EARTHLY WANDERINGS AND LEFT US ALL DEEPLY BEREAVED. HIS MOST ARDENT
LONGING WAS TO BE ABLE TO HELP HIS SON TO ADVANCE IN A CAREER AND THUS
SAVE ME FROM THE HARSH ORDEAL THAT HE HIMSELF HAD TO GO THROUGH. BUT IT
APPEARED TO HIM THEN AS IF THAT LONGING WERE ALL IN VAIN. AND YET,
THOUGH HE HIMSELF WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF IT, HE HAD SOWN THE SEEDS OF A
FUTURE WHICH NEITHER OF US FORESAW AT THAT TIME.

AT FIRST NOTHING CHANGED OUTWARDLY.

MY MOTHER FELT IT HER DUTY TO CONTINUE MY EDUCATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH
MY FATHER'S WISHES, WHICH MEANT THAT SHE WOULD HAVE ME STUDY FOR THE
CIVIL SERVICE. FOR MY OWN PART I WAS EVEN MORE FIRMLY DETERMINED THAN
EVER BEFORE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD I BECOME AN OFFICIAL OF
THE STATE. THE CURRICULUM AND TEACHING METHODS FOLLOWED IN THE MIDDLE
SCHOOL WERE SO FAR REMOVED FROM MY IDEALS THAT I BECAME PROFOUNDLY
INDIFFERENT. ILLNESS SUDDENLY CAME TO MY ASSISTANCE. WITHIN A FEW WEEKS
IT DECIDED MY FUTURE AND PUT AN END TO THE LONG-STANDING FAMILY
CONFLICT. MY LUNGS BECAME SO SERIOUSLY AFFECTED THAT THE DOCTOR ADVISED
MY MOTHER VERY STRONGLY NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TO ALLOW ME TO TAKE
UP A CAREER WHICH WOULD NECESSITATE WORKING IN AN OFFICE. HE ORDERED
THAT I SHOULD GIVE UP ATTENDANCE AT THE REALSCHULE FOR A YEAR AT LEAST.
WHAT I HAD SECRETLY DESIRED FOR SUCH A LONG TIME, AND HAD PERSISTENTLY
FOUGHT FOR, NOW BECAME A REALITY ALMOST AT ONE STROKE.

INFLUENCED BY MY ILLNESS, MY MOTHER AGREED THAT I SHOULD LEAVE THE
REALSCHULE AND ATTEND THE ACADEMY.

THOSE WERE HAPPY DAYS, WHICH APPEARED TO ME ALMOST AS A DREAM; BUT THEY
WERE BOUND TO REMAIN ONLY A DREAM. TWO YEARS LATER MY MOTHER'S DEATH PUT
A BRUTAL END TO ALL MY FINE PROJECTS. SHE SUCCUMBED TO A LONG AND
PAINFUL ILLNESS WHICH FROM THE VERY BEGINNING PERMITTED LITTLE HOPE OF
RECOVERY. THOUGH EXPECTED, HER DEATH CAME AS A TERRIBLE BLOW TO ME. I
RESPECTED MY FATHER, BUT I LOVED MY MOTHER.

POVERTY AND STERN REALITY FORCED ME TO DECIDE PROMPTLY.

THE MEAGRE RESOURCES OF THE FAMILY HAD BEEN ALMOST ENTIRELY USED UP
THROUGH MY MOTHER'S SEVERE ILLNESS. THE ALLOWANCE WHICH CAME TO ME AS AN
ORPHAN WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE BARE NECESSITIES OF LIFE. SOMEHOW OR OTHER
I WOULD HAVE TO EARN MY OWN BREAD.

WITH MY CLOTHES AND LINEN PACKED IN A VALISE AND WITH AN INDOMITABLE
RESOLUTION IN MY HEART, I LEFT FOR VIENNA. I HOPED TO FORESTALL FATE, AS
MY FATHER HAD DONE FIFTY YEARS BEFORE. I WAS DETERMINED TO BECOME
'SOMETHING'--BUT CERTAINLY NOT A CIVIL SERVANT.




CHAPTER II



YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA


WHEN MY MOTHER DIED MY FATE HAD ALREADY BEEN DECIDED IN ONE RESPECT.
DURING THE LAST MONTHS OF HER ILLNESS I WENT TO VIENNA TO TAKE THE
ENTRANCE EXAMINATION FOR THE ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS. ARMED WITH A BULKY
PACKET OF SKETCHES, I FELT CONVINCED THAT I SHOULD PASS THE EXAMINATION
QUITE EASILY. AT THE REALSCHULE I WAS BY FAR THE BEST STUDENT IN THE
DRAWING CLASS, AND SINCE THAT TIME I HAD MADE MORE THAN ORDINARY
PROGRESS IN THE PRACTICE OF DRAWING. THEREFORE I WAS PLEASED WITH MYSELF
AND WAS PROUD AND HAPPY AT THE PROSPECT OF WHAT I CONSIDERED AN ASSURED
SUCCESS.

BUT THERE WAS ONE MISGIVING: IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I WAS BETTER QUALIFIED
FOR DRAWING THAN FOR PAINTING, ESPECIALLY IN THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF
ARCHITECTURAL DRAWING. AT THE SAME TIME MY INTEREST IN ARCHITECTURE WAS
CONSTANTLY INCREASING. AND I ADVANCED IN THIS DIRECTION AT A STILL MORE
RAPID PACE AFTER MY FIRST VISIT TO VIENNA, WHICH LASTED TWO WEEKS. I WAS
NOT YET SIXTEEN YEARS OLD. I WENT TO THE HOF MUSEUM TO STUDY THE
PAINTINGS IN THE ART GALLERY THERE; BUT THE BUILDING ITSELF CAPTURED
ALMOST ALL MY INTEREST, FROM EARLY MORNING UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT I SPENT
ALL MY TIME VISITING THE VARIOUS PUBLIC BUILDINGS. AND IT WAS THE
BUILDINGS THEMSELVES THAT WERE ALWAYS THE PRINCIPAL ATTRACTION FOR ME.
FOR HOURS AND HOURS I COULD STAND IN WONDERMENT BEFORE THE OPERA AND THE
PARLIAMENT. THE WHOLE RING STRASSE HAD A MAGIC EFFECT UPON ME, AS IF IT
WERE A SCENE FROM THE THOUSAND-AND-ONE-NIGHTS.

AND NOW I WAS HERE FOR THE SECOND TIME IN THIS BEAUTIFUL CITY,
IMPATIENTLY WAITING TO HEAR THE RESULT OF THE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION BUT
PROUDLY CONFIDENT THAT I HAD GOT THROUGH. I WAS SO CONVINCED OF MY
SUCCESS THAT WHEN THE NEWS THAT I HAD FAILED TO PASS WAS BROUGHT TO ME
IT STRUCK ME LIKE A BOLT FROM THE SKIES. YET THE FACT WAS THAT I HAD
FAILED. I WENT TO SEE THE RECTOR AND ASKED HIM TO EXPLAIN THE REASONS
WHY THEY REFUSED TO ACCEPT ME AS A STUDENT IN THE GENERAL SCHOOL OF
PAINTING, WHICH WAS PART OF THE ACADEMY. HE SAID THAT THE SKETCHES WHICH
I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME UNQUESTIONABLY SHOWED THAT PAINTING WAS NOT WHAT I
WAS SUITED FOR BUT THAT THE SAME SKETCHES GAVE CLEAR INDICATIONS OF MY
APTITUDE FOR ARCHITECTURAL DESIGNING. THEREFORE THE SCHOOL OF PAINTING
DID NOT COME INTO QUESTION FOR ME BUT RATHER THE SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE,
WHICH ALSO FORMED PART OF THE ACADEMY. AT FIRST IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD BE SO, SEEING THAT I HAD NEVER BEEN TO A
SCHOOL FOR ARCHITECTURE AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED ANY INSTRUCTION IN
ARCHITECTURAL DESIGNING.

WHEN I LEFT THE HANSEN PALACE, ON THE SCHILLER PLATZ, I WAS QUITE
CRESTFALLEN. I FELT OUT OF SORTS WITH MYSELF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY
YOUNG LIFE. FOR WHAT I HAD HEARD ABOUT MY CAPABILITIES NOW APPEARED TO
ME AS A LIGHTNING FLASH WHICH CLEARLY REVEALED A DUALISM UNDER WHICH I
HAD BEEN SUFFERING FOR A LONG TIME, BUT HITHERTO I COULD GIVE NO CLEAR
ACCOUNT WHATSOEVER OF THE WHY AND WHEREFORE.

WITHIN A FEW DAYS I MYSELF ALSO KNEW THAT I OUGHT TO BECOME AN
ARCHITECT. BUT OF COURSE THE WAY WAS VERY DIFFICULT. I WAS NOW FORCED
BITTERLY TO RUE MY FORMER CONDUCT IN NEGLECTING AND DESPISING CERTAIN
SUBJECTS AT THE REALSCHULE. BEFORE TAKING UP THE COURSES AT THE SCHOOL
OF ARCHITECTURE IN THE ACADEMY IT WAS NECESSARY TO ATTEND THE TECHNICAL
BUILDING SCHOOL; BUT A NECESSARY QUALIFICATION FOR ENTRANCE INTO THIS
SCHOOL WAS A LEAVING CERTIFICATE FROM THE MIDDLE SCHOOL. AND THIS I
SIMPLY DID NOT HAVE. ACCORDING TO THE HUMAN MEASURE OF THINGS MY DREAM
OF FOLLOWING AN ARTISTIC CALLING SEEMED BEYOND THE LIMITS OF
POSSIBILITY.

AFTER THE DEATH OF MY MOTHER I CAME TO VIENNA FOR THE THIRD TIME. THIS
VISIT WAS DESTINED TO LAST SEVERAL YEARS. SINCE I HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE
I HAD RECOVERED MY OLD CALM AND RESOLUTENESS. THE FORMER SELF-ASSURANCE
HAD COME BACK, AND I HAD MY EYES STEADILY FIXED ON THE GOAL. I WOULD BE
AN ARCHITECT. OBSTACLES ARE PLACED ACROSS OUR PATH IN LIFE, NOT TO BE
BOGGLED AT BUT TO BE SURMOUNTED. AND I WAS FULLY DETERMINED TO SURMOUNT
THESE OBSTACLES, HAVING THE PICTURE OF MY FATHER CONSTANTLY BEFORE MY
MIND, WHO HAD RAISED HIMSELF BY HIS OWN EFFORTS TO THE POSITION OF A
CIVIL SERVANT THOUGH HE WAS THE POOR SON OF A VILLAGE SHOEMAKER. I HAD A
BETTER START, AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF STRUGGLING THROUGH WERE BETTER.
AT THAT TIME MY LOT IN LIFE SEEMED TO ME A HARSH ONE; BUT TO-DAY I SEE
IN IT THE WISE WORKINGS OF PROVIDENCE. THE GODDESS OF FATE CLUTCHED ME
IN HER HANDS AND OFTEN THREATENED TO SMASH ME; BUT THE WILL GREW
STRONGER AS THE OBSTACLES INCREASED, AND FINALLY THE WILL TRIUMPHED.

I AM THANKFUL FOR THAT PERIOD OF MY LIFE, BECAUSE IT HARDENED ME AND
ENABLED ME TO BE AS TOUGH AS I NOW AM. AND I AM EVEN MORE THANKFUL
BECAUSE I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT I WAS THUS SAVED FROM THE EMPTINESS
OF A LIFE OF EASE AND THAT A MOTHER'S DARLING WAS TAKEN FROM TENDER ARMS
AND HANDED OVER TO ADVERSITY AS TO A NEW MOTHER. THOUGH I THEN REBELLED
AGAINST IT AS TOO HARD A FATE, I AM GRATEFUL THAT I WAS THROWN INTO A
WORLD OF MISERY AND POVERTY AND THUS CAME TO KNOW THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM I
WAS AFTERWARDS TO FIGHT.

IT WAS DURING THIS PERIOD THAT MY EYES WERE OPENED TO TWO PERILS, THE
NAMES OF WHICH I SCARCELY KNEW HITHERTO AND HAD NO NOTION WHATSOEVER OF
THEIR TERRIBLE SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE.
THESE TWO PERILS WERE MARXISM AND JUDAISM.

FOR MANY PEOPLE THE NAME OF VIENNA SIGNIFIES INNOCENT JOLLITY, A FESTIVE
PLACE FOR HAPPY MORTALS. FOR ME, ALAS, IT IS A LIVING MEMORY OF THE
SADDEST PERIOD IN MY LIFE. EVEN TO-DAY THE MENTION OF THAT CITY AROUSES
ONLY GLOOMY THOUGHTS IN MY MIND. FIVE YEARS OF POVERTY IN THAT PHAECIAN
(NOTE 5) TOWN. FIVE YEARS IN WHICH, FIRST AS A CASUAL LABOURER AND THEN AS
A PAINTER OF LITTLE TRIFLES, I HAD TO EARN MY DAILY BREAD. AND A MEAGRE
MORSEL INDEED IT WAS, NOT EVEN SUFFICIENT TO STILL THE HUNGER WHICH I
CONSTANTLY FELT. THAT HUNGER WAS THE FAITHFUL GUARDIAN WHICH NEVER LEFT
ME BUT TOOK PART IN EVERYTHING I DID. EVERY BOOK THAT I BOUGHT MEANT
RENEWED HUNGER, AND EVERY VISIT I PAID TO THE OPERA MEANT THE INTRUSION
OF THAT INALIENABL COMPANION DURING THE FOLLOWING DAYS. I WAS ALWAYS
STRUGGLING WITH MY UNSYMPATHIC FRIEND. AND YET DURING THAT TIME I
LEARNED MORE THAN I HAD EVER LEARNED BEFORE. OUTSIDE MY ARCHITECTURAL
STUDIES AND RARE VISITS TO THE OPERA, FOR WHICH I HAD TO DENY MYSELF
FOOD, I HAD NO OTHER PLEASURE IN LIFE EXCEPT MY BOOKS.

[NOTE 5. THE PHAECIANS WERE A LEGENDARY PEOPLE, MENTIONED IN HOMER'S
ODYSSEY. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO LIVE ON SOME UNKNOWN ISLAND IN THE EASTERN
MEDITERRANEAN, SOMETIMES SUGGESTED TO BE CORCYRA, THE MODERN CORFU. THEY
LOVED GOOD LIVING MORE THAN WORK, AND SO THE NAME PHAECIAN HAS COME TO BE
A SYNONYM FOR PARASITE.]

I READ A GREAT DEAL THEN, AND I PONDERED DEEPLY OVER WHAT I READ. ALL
THE FREE TIME AFTER WORK WAS DEVOTED EXCLUSIVELY TO STUDY. THUS WITHIN A
FEW YEARS I WAS ABLE TO ACQUIRE A STOCK OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH I FIND USEFUL
EVEN TO-DAY.

BUT MORE THAN THAT. DURING THOSE YEARS A VIEW OF LIFE AND A DEFINITE
OUTLOOK ON THE WORLD TOOK SHAPE IN MY MIND. THESE BECAME THE GRANITE
BASIS OF MY CONDUCT AT THAT TIME. SINCE THEN I HAVE EXTENDED THAT
FOUNDATION ONLY VERY LITTLE, AND I HAVE CHANGED NOTHING IN IT.

ON THE CONTRARY: I AM FIRMLY CONVINCED TO-DAY THAT, GENERALLY SPEAKING,
IT IS IN YOUTH THAT MEN LAY THE ESSENTIAL GROUNDWORK OF THEIR CREATIVE
THOUGHT, WHEREVER THAT CREATIVE THOUGHT EXISTS. I MAKE A DISTINCTION
BETWEEN THE WISDOM OF AGE--WHICH CAN ONLY ARISE FROM THE GREATER
PROFUNDITY AND FORESIGHT THAT ARE BASED ON THE EXPERIENCES OF A LONG
LIFE--AND THE CREATIVE GENIUS OF YOUTH, WHICH BLOSSOMS OUT IN THOUGHT
AND IDEAS WITH INEXHAUSTIBLE FERTILITY, WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO PUT THESE
INTO PRACTICE IMMEDIATELY, BECAUSE OF THEIR VERY SUPERABUNDANCE. THESE
FURNISH THE BUILDING MATERIALS AND PLANS FOR THE FUTURE; AND IT IS FROM
THEM THAT AGE TAKES THE STONES AND BUILDS THE EDIFICE, UNLESS THE
SO-CALLED WISDOM OF THE YEARS MAY HAVE SMOTHERED THE CREATIVE GENIUS OF
YOUTH.

THE LIFE WHICH I HAD HITHERTO LED AT HOME WITH MY PARENTS DIFFERED IN
LITTLE OR NOTHING FROM THAT OF ALL THE OTHERS. I LOOKED FORWARD WITHOUT
APPREHENSION TO THE MORROW, AND THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS A SOCIAL
PROBLEM TO BE FACED. THOSE AMONG WHOM I PASSED MY YOUNG DAYS BELONGED TO
THE SMALL BOURGEOIS CLASS. THEREFORE IT WAS A WORLD THAT HAD VERY LITTLE
CONTACT WITH THE WORLD OF GENUINE MANUAL LABOURERS. FOR, THOUGH AT FIRST
THIS MAY APPEAR ASTONISHING, THE DITCH WHICH SEPARATES THAT CLASS, WHICH
IS BY NO MEANS ECONOMICALLY WELL-OFF; FROM THE MANUAL LABOURING CLASS IS
OFTEN DEEPER THAN PEOPLE THINK. THE REASON FOR THIS DIVISION, WHICH WE
MAY ALMOST CALL ENMITY, LIES IN THE FEAR THAT DOMINATES A SOCIAL GROUP
WHICH HAS ONLY JUST RISEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE MANUAL LABOURER--A FEAR
LEST IT MAY FALL BACK INTO ITS OLD CONDITION OR AT LEAST BE CLASSED WITH
THE LABOURERS. MOREOVER, THERE IS SOMETHING REPULSIVE IN REMEMBERING THE
CULTURAL INDIGENCE OF THAT LOWER CLASS AND THEIR ROUGH MANNERS WITH ONE
ANOTHER; SO THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ONLY ON THE FIRST RUNG OF THE SOCIAL
LADDER FIND IT UNBEARABLE TO BE FORCED TO HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH THE
CULTURAL LEVEL AND STANDARD OF LIVING OUT OF WHICH THEY HAVE PASSED.

AND SO IT HAPPENS THAT VERY OFTEN THOSE WHO BELONG TO WHAT CAN REALLY BE
CALLED THE UPPER CLASSES FIND IT MUCH EASIER THAN DO THE UPSTARTS TO
DESCEND TO AND INTERMINGLE WITH THEIR FELLOW BEINGS ON THE LOWEST SOCIAL
LEVEL. FOR BY THE WORD UPSTART I MEAN EVERYONE WHO HAS RAISED HIMSELF
THROUGH HIS OWN EFFORTS TO A SOCIAL LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAT TO WHICH HE
FORMERLY BELONGED. IN THE CASE OF SUCH A PERSON THE HARD STRUGGLE
THROUGH WHICH HE PASSES OFTEN DESTROYS HIS NORMAL HUMAN SYMPATHY. HIS
OWN FIGHT FOR EXISTENCE KILLS HIS SENSIBILITY FOR THE MISERY OF THOSE
WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND.

FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW FATE HAD BEEN KIND TO ME. CIRCUMSTANCES FORCED
ME TO RETURN TO THAT WORLD OF POVERTY AND ECONOMIC INSECURITY ABOVE
WHICH MY FATHER HAD RAISED HIMSELF IN HIS EARLY DAYS; AND THUS THE
BLINKERS OF A NARROW PETIT BOURGEOIS EDUCATION WERE TORN FROM MY EYES.
NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME I LEARNED TO KNOW MEN AND I LEARNED TO
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN EMPTY APPEARANCES OR BRUTAL MANNERS AND THE REAL
INNER NATURE OF THE PEOPLE WHO OUTWARDLY APPEARED THUS.

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY VIENNA HAD ALREADY TAKEN RANK AMONG
THOSE CITIES WHERE SOCIAL CONDITIONS ARE INIQUITOUS. DAZZLING RICHES AND
LOATHSOME DESTITUTION WERE INTERMINGLED IN VIOLENT CONTRAST. IN THE
CENTRE AND IN THE INNER CITY ONE FELT THE PULSE-BEAT OF AN EMPIRE WHICH
HAD A POPULATION OF FIFTY-TWO MILLIONS, WITH ALL THE PERILOUS CHARM OF A
STATE MADE UP OF MULTIPLE NATIONALITIES. THE DAZZLING SPLENDOUR OF THE
COURT ACTED LIKE A MAGNET ON THE WEALTH AND INTELLIGENCE OF THE WHOLE
EMPIRE. AND THIS ATTRACTION WAS FURTHER STRENGTHENED BY THE DYNASTIC
POLICY OF THE HABSBURG MONARCHY IN CENTRALIZING EVERYTHING IN ITSELF AND
FOR ITSELF.

THIS CENTRALIZING POLICY WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO HOLD TOGETHER THAT
HOTCHPOTCH OF HETEROGENEOUS NATIONALITIES. BUT THE RESULT OF IT WAS AN
EXTRAORDINARY CONCENTRATION OF HIGHER OFFICIALS IN THE CITY, WHICH WAS
AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME THE METROPOLIS AND IMPERIAL RESIDENCE.

BUT VIENNA WAS NOT MERELY THE POLITICAL AND INTELLECTUAL CENTRE OF THE
DANUBIAN MONARCHY; IT WAS ALSO THE COMMERCIAL CENTRE. BESIDES THE HORDE
OF MILITARY OFFICERS OF HIGH RANK, STATE OFFICIALS, ARTISTS AND
SCIENTISTS, THERE WAS THE STILL VASTER HORDE OF WORKERS. ABJECT POVERTY
CONFRONTED THE WEALTH OF THE ARISTOCRACY AND THE MERCHANT CLASS FACE TO
FACE. THOUSANDS OF UNEMPLOYED LOITERED IN FRONT OF THE PALACES ON THE
RING STRASSE; AND BELOW THAT VIA TRIUMPHALIS OF THE OLD AUSTRIA THE
HOMELESS HUDDLED TOGETHER IN THE MURK AND FILTH OF THE CANALS.

THERE WAS HARDLY ANY OTHER GERMAN CITY IN WHICH THE SOCIAL PROBLEM COULD
BE STUDIED BETTER THAN IN VIENNA. BUT HERE I MUST UTTER A WARNING
AGAINST THE ILLUSION THAT THIS PROBLEM CAN BE 'STUDIED' FROM ABOVE
DOWNWARDS. THE MAN WHO HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE CLUTCHES OF THAT CRUSHING
VIPER CAN NEVER KNOW WHAT ITS POISON IS. AN ATTEMPT TO STUDY IT IN ANY
OTHER WAY WILL RESULT ONLY IN SUPERFICIAL TALK AND SENTIMENTAL
DELUSIONS. BOTH ARE HARMFUL. THE FIRST BECAUSE IT CAN NEVER GO TO THE
ROOT OF THE QUESTION, THE SECOND BECAUSE IT EVADES THE QUESTION
ENTIRELY. I DO NOT KNOW WHICH IS THE MORE NEFARIOUS: TO IGNORE SOCIAL
DISTRESS, AS DO THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN FAVOURED BY FORTUNE
AND THOSE WHO HAVE RISEN IN THE SOCIAL SCALE THROUGH THEIR OWN ROUTINE
LABOUR, OR THE EQUALLY SUPERCILIOUS AND OFTEN TACTLESS BUT ALWAYS
GENTEEL CONDESCENSION DISPLAYED BY PEOPLE WHO MAKE A FAD OF BEING
CHARITABLE AND WHO PLUME THEMSELVES ON 'SYMPATHISING WITH THE PEOPLE.'
OF COURSE SUCH PERSONS SIN MORE THAN THEY CAN IMAGINE FROM LACK OF
INSTINCTIVE UNDERSTANDING. AND THUS THEY ARE ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT THE
'SOCIAL CONSCIENCE' ON WHICH THEY PRIDE THEMSELVES NEVER PRODUCES ANY
RESULTS, BUT OFTEN CAUSES THEIR GOOD INTENTIONS TO BE RESENTED; AND THEN
THEY TALK OF THE INGRATITUDE OF THE PEOPLE.

SUCH PERSONS ARE SLOW TO LEARN THAT HERE THERE IS NO PLACE FOR MERELY
SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND THAT THERE CAN BE NO EXPECTATION OF GRATITUDE; FOR
IN THIS CONNECTION THERE IS NO QUESTION AT ALL OF DISTRIBUTING FAVOURS
BUT ESSENTIALLY A MATTER OF RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE. I WAS PROTECTED AGAINST
THE TEMPTATION TO STUDY THE SOCIAL QUESTION IN THE WAY JUST MENTIONED,
FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT I WAS FORCED TO LIVE IN THE MIDST OF
POVERTY-STRICKEN PEOPLE. THEREFORE IT WAS NOT A QUESTION OF STUDYING THE
PROBLEM OBJECTIVELY, BUT RATHER ONE OF TESTING ITS EFFECTS ON MYSELF.
THOUGH THE RABBIT CAME THROUGH THE ORDEAL OF THE EXPERIMENT, THIS MUST
NOT BE TAKEN AS EVIDENCE OF ITS HARMLESSNESS.

WHEN I TRY TO-DAY TO RECALL THE SUCCESSION OF IMPRESSIONS RECEIVED
DURING THAT TIME I FIND THAT I CAN DO SO ONLY WITH APPROXIMATE
COMPLETENESS. HERE I SHALL DESCRIBE ONLY THE MORE ESSENTIAL IMPRESSIONS
AND THOSE WHICH PERSONALLY AFFECTED ME AND OFTEN STAGGERED ME. AND I
SHALL MENTION THE FEW LESSONS I THEN LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE.

AT THAT TIME IT WAS FOR THE MOST PART NOT VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND WORK,
BECAUSE I HAD TO SEEK WORK NOT AS A SKILLED TRADESMAN BUT AS A SO-CALLED
EXTRA-HAND READY TO TAKE ANY JOB THAT TURNED UP BY CHANCE, JUST FOR THE
SAKE OF EARNING MY DAILY BREAD.

THUS I FOUND MYSELF IN THE SAME SITUATION AS ALL THOSE EMIGRANTS WHO
SHAKE THE DUST OF EUROPE FROM THEIR FEET, WITH THE CAST-IRON
DETERMINATION TO LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF A NEW EXISTENCE IN THE NEW WORLD
AND ACQUIRE FOR THEMSELVES A NEW HOME. LIBERATED FROM ALL THE PARALYSING
PREJUDICES OF CLASS AND CALLING, ENVIRONMENT AND TRADITION, THEY ENTER
ANY SERVICE THAT OPENS ITS DOORS TO THEM, ACCEPTING ANY WORK THAT COMES
THEIR WAY, FILLED MORE AND MORE WITH THE IDEA THAT HONEST WORK NEVER
DISGRACED ANYBODY, NO MATTER WHAT KIND IT MAY BE. AND SO I WAS RESOLVED
TO SET BOTH FEET IN WHAT WAS FOR ME A NEW WORLD AND PUSH FORWARD ON MY
OWN ROAD.

I SOON FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS SOME KIND OF WORK ALWAYS TO BE GOT, BUT
I ALSO LEARNED THAT IT COULD JUST AS QUICKLY AND EASILY BE LOST. THE
UNCERTAINTY OF BEING ABLE TO EARN A REGULAR DAILY LIVELIHOOD SOON
APPEARED TO ME AS THE GLOOMIEST FEATURE IN THIS NEW LIFE THAT I HAD
ENTERED.

ALTHOUGH THE SKILLED WORKER WAS NOT SO FREQUENTLY THROWN IDLE ON THE
STREETS AS THE UNSKILLED WORKER, YET THE FORMER WAS BY NO MEANS
PROTECTED AGAINST THE SAME FATE; BECAUSE THOUGH HE MAY NOT HAVE TO FACE
HUNGER AS A RESULT OF UNEMPLOYMENT DUE TO THE LACK OF DEMAND IN THE
LABOUR MARKET, THE LOCK-OUT AND THE STRIKE DEPRIVED THE SKILLED WORKER
OF THE CHANCE TO EARN HIS BREAD. HERE THE ELEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY IN
STEADILY EARNING ONE'S DAILY BREAD WAS THE BITTEREST FEATURE OF THE
WHOLE SOCIAL-ECONOMIC SYSTEM ITSELF.

THE COUNTRY LAD WHO MIGRATES TO THE BIG CITY FEELS ATTRACTED BY WHAT HAS
BEEN DESCRIBED AS EASY WORK--WHICH IT MAY BE IN REALITY--AND FEW WORKING
HOURS. HE IS ESPECIALLY ENTRANCED BY THE MAGIC GLIMMER SPREAD OVER THE
BIG CITIES. ACCUSTOMED IN THE COUNTRY TO EARN A STEADY WAGE, HE HAS BEEN
TAUGHT NOT TO QUIT HIS FORMER POST UNTIL A NEW ONE IS AT LEAST IN SIGHT.
AS THERE IS A GREAT SCARCITY OF AGRICULTURAL LABOUR, THE PROBABILITY OF
LONG UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN VERY SMALL. IT IS A MISTAKE TO
PRESUME THAT THE LAD WHO LEAVES THE COUNTRYSIDE FOR THE TOWN IS NOT MADE
OF SUCH SOUND MATERIAL AS THOSE WHO REMAIN AT HOME TO WORK ON THE LAND.
ON THE CONTRARY, EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT IT IS THE MORE HEALTHY AND MORE
VIGOROUS THAT EMIGRATE, AND NOT THE REVERSE. AMONG THESE EMIGRANTS I
INCLUDE NOT MERELY THOSE WHO EMIGRATE TO AMERICA, BUT ALSO THE SERVANT
BOY IN THE COUNTRY WHO DECIDES TO LEAVE HIS NATIVE VILLAGE AND MIGRATE
TO THE BIG CITY WHERE HE WILL BE A STRANGER. HE IS READY TO TAKE THE
RISK OF AN UNCERTAIN FATE. IN MOST CASES HE COMES TO TOWN WITH A LITTLE
MONEY IN HIS POCKET AND FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS HE IS NOT DISCOURAGED IF
HE SHOULD NOT HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND WORK. BUT IF HE FINDS A JOB
AND THEN LOSES IT IN A LITTLE WHILE, THE CASE IS MUCH WORSE. TO FIND
WORK ANEW, ESPECIALLY IN WINTER, IS OFTEN DIFFICULT AND INDEED SOMETIMES
IMPOSSIBLE. FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS LIFE IS STILL BEARABLE HE RECEIVES
HIS OUT-OF-WORK MONEY FROM HIS TRADE UNION AND IS THUS ENABLED TO CARRY
ON. BUT WHEN THE LAST OF HIS OWN MONEY IS GONE AND HIS TRADE UNION
CEASES TO PAY OUT BECAUSE OF THE PROLONGED UNEMPLOYMENT, THEN COMES THE
REAL DISTRESS. HE NOW LOITERS ABOUT AND IS HUNGRY. OFTEN HE PAWNS OR
SELLS THE LAST OF HIS BELONGINGS. HIS CLOTHES BEGIN TO GET SHABBY AND
WITH THE INCREASING POVERTY OF HIS OUTWARD APPEARANCE HE DESCENDS TO A
LOWER SOCIAL LEVEL AND MIXES UP WITH A CLASS OF HUMAN BEINGS THROUGH
WHOM HIS MIND IS NOW POISONED, IN ADDITION TO HIS PHYSICAL MISERY. THEN
HE HAS NOWHERE TO SLEEP AND IF THAT HAPPENS IN WINTER, WHICH IS VERY
OFTEN THE CASE, HE IS IN DIRE DISTRESS. FINALLY HE GETS WORK. BUT THE
OLD STORY REPEATS ITSELF. A SECOND TIME THE SAME THING HAPPENS. THEN A
THIRD TIME; AND NOW IT IS PROBABLY MUCH WORSE. LITTLE BY LITTLE HE
BECOMES INDIFFERENT TO THIS EVERLASTING INSECURITY. FINALLY HE GROWS
USED TO THE REPETITION. THUS EVEN A MAN WHO IS NORMALLY OF INDUSTRIOUS
HABITS GROWS CARELESS IN HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE TOWARDS LIFE AND GRADUALLY
BECOMES AN INSTRUMENT IN THE HANDS OF UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE WHO EXPLOIT
HIM FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR OWN IGNOBLE AIMS. HE HAS BEEN SO OFTEN THROWN
OUT OF EMPLOYMENT THROUGH NO FAULT OF HIS OWN THAT HE IS NOW MORE OR
LESS INDIFFERENT WHETHER THE STRIKE IN WHICH HE TAKES PART BE FOR THE
PURPOSE OF SECURING HIS ECONOMIC RIGHTS OR BE AIMED AT THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE STATE, THE WHOLE SOCIAL ORDER AND EVEN CIVILIZATION ITSELF.
THOUGH THE IDEA OF GOING ON STRIKE MAY NOT BE TO HIS NATURAL LIKING, YET
HE JOINS IN IT OUT OF SHEER INDIFFERENCE.

I SAW THIS PROCESS EXEMPLIFIED BEFORE MY EYES IN THOUSANDS OF CASES. AND
THE LONGER I OBSERVED IT THE GREATER BECAME MY DISLIKE FOR THAT MAMMOTH
CITY WHICH GREEDILY ATTRACTS MEN TO ITS BOSOM, IN ORDER TO BREAK THEM
MERCILESSLY IN THE END. WHEN THEY CAME THEY STILL FELT THEMSELVES IN
COMMUNION WITH THEIR OWN PEOPLE AT HOME; IF THEY REMAINED THAT TIE WAS
BROKEN.

I WAS THROWN ABOUT SO MUCH IN THE LIFE OF THE METROPOLIS THAT I
EXPERIENCED THE WORKINGS OF THIS FATE IN MY OWN PERSON AND FELT THE
EFFECTS OF IT IN MY OWN SOUL. ONE THING STOOD OUT CLEARLY BEFORE MY
EYES: IT WAS THE SUDDEN CHANGES FROM WORK TO IDLENESS AND VICE VERSA; SO
THAT THE CONSTANT FLUCTUATIONS THUS CAUSED BY EARNINGS AND EXPENDITURE
FINALLY DESTROYED THE 'SENSE OF THRIFT FOR MANY PEOPLE AND ALSO THE
HABIT OF REGULATING EXPENDITURE IN AN INTELLIGENT WAY. THE BODY APPEARED
TO GROW ACCUSTOMED TO THE VICISSITUDES OF FOOD AND HUNGER, EATING
HEARTILY IN GOOD TIMES AND GOING HUNGRY IN BAD. INDEED HUNGER SHATTERS
ALL PLANS FOR RATIONING EXPENDITURE ON A REGULAR SCALE IN BETTER TIMES
WHEN EMPLOYMENT IS AGAIN FOUND. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE
DEPRIVATIONS WHICH THE UNEMPLOYED WORKER HAS TO ENDURE MUST BE
COMPENSATED FOR PSYCHOLOGICALLY BY A PERSISTENT MENTAL MIRAGE IN WHICH
HE IMAGINES HIMSELF EATING HEARTILY ONCE AGAIN. AND THIS DREAM DEVELOPS
INTO SUCH A LONGING THAT IT TURNS INTO A MORBID IMPULSE TO CAST OFF ALL
SELF-RESTRAINT WHEN WORK AND WAGES TURN UP AGAIN. THEREFORE THE MOMENT
WORK IS FOUND ANEW HE FORGETS TO REGULATE THE EXPENDITURE OF HIS
EARNINGS BUT SPENDS THEM TO THE FULL WITHOUT THINKING OF TO-MORROW. THIS
LEADS TO CONFUSION IN THE LITTLE WEEKLY HOUSEKEEPING BUDGET, BECAUSE THE
EXPENDITURE IS NOT RATIONALLY PLANNED. WHEN THE PHENOMENON WHICH I HAVE
MENTIONED FIRST HAPPENS, THE EARNINGS WILL LAST PERHAPS FOR FIVE DAYS
INSTEAD OF SEVEN; ON SUBSEQUENT OCCASIONS THEY WILL LAST ONLY FOR THREE
DAYS; AS THE HABIT RECURS, THE EARNINGS WILL LAST SCARCELY FOR A DAY;
AND FINALLY THEY WILL DISAPPEAR IN ONE NIGHT OF FEASTING.

OFTEN THERE ARE WIFE AND CHILDREN AT HOME. AND IN MANY CASES IT HAPPENS
THAT THESE BECOME INFECTED BY SUCH A WAY OF LIVING, ESPECIALLY IF THE
HUSBAND IS GOOD TO THEM AND WANTS TO DO THE BEST HE CAN FOR THEM AND
LOVES THEM IN HIS OWN WAY AND ACCORDING TO HIS OWN LIGHTS. THEN THE
WEEK'S EARNINGS ARE SPENT IN COMMON AT HOME WITHIN TWO OR THREE DAYS.
THE FAMILY EAT AND DRINK TOGETHER AS LONG AS THE MONEY LASTS AND AT THE
END OF THE WEEK THEY HUNGER TOGETHER. THEN THE WIFE WANDERS ABOUT
FURTIVELY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, BORROWS A LITTLE, AND RUNS UP SMALL
DEBTS WITH THE SHOPKEEPERS IN AN EFFORT TO PULL THROUGH THE LEAN DAYS
TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEK. THEY SIT DOWN TOGETHER TO THE MIDDAY MEAL
WITH ONLY MEAGRE FARE ON THE TABLE, AND OFTEN EVEN NOTHING TO EAT. THEY
WAIT FOR THE COMING PAYDAY, TALKING OF IT AND MAKING PLANS; AND WHILE
THEY ARE THUS HUNGRY THEY DREAM OF THE PLENTY THAT IS TO COME. AND SO
THE LITTLE CHILDREN BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH MISERY IN THEIR EARLY YEARS.

BUT THE EVIL CULMINATES WHEN THE HUSBAND GOES HIS OWN WAY FROM THE
BEGINNING OF THE WEEK AND THE WIFE PROTESTS, SIMPLY OUT OF LOVE FOR THE
CHILDREN. THEN THERE ARE QUARRELS AND BAD FEELING AND THE HUSBAND TAKES
TO DRINK ACCORDING AS HE BECOMES ESTRANGED FROM HIS WIFE. HE NOW BECOMES
DRUNK EVERY SATURDAY. FIGHTING FOR HER OWN EXISTENCE AND THAT OF THE
CHILDREN, THE WIFE HAS TO HOUND HIM ALONG THE ROAD FROM THE FACTORY TO
THE TAVERN IN ORDER TO GET A FEW SHILLINGS FROM HIM ON PAYDAY. THEN WHEN
HE FINALLY COMES HOME, MAYBE ON THE SUNDAY OR THE MONDAY, HAVING PARTED
WITH HIS LAST SHILLINGS AND PENCE, PITIABLE SCENES FOLLOW, SCENES THAT
CRY OUT FOR GOD'S MERCY.

I HAVE HAD ACTUAL EXPERIENCE OF ALL THIS IN HUNDREDS OF CASES. AT FIRST
I WAS DISGUSTED AND INDIGNANT; BUT LATER ON I CAME TO RECOGNIZE THE
WHOLE TRAGEDY OF THEIR MISFORTUNE AND TO UNDERSTAND THE PROFOUND CAUSES
OF IT. THEY WERE THE UNHAPPY VICTIMS OF EVIL CIRCUMSTANCES.

HOUSING CONDITIONS WERE VERY BAD AT THAT TIME. THE VIENNA MANUAL
LABOURERS LIVED IN SURROUNDINGS OF APPALLING MISERY. I SHUDDER EVEN
TO-DAY WHEN I THINK OF THE WOEFUL DENS IN WHICH PEOPLE DWELT, THE NIGHT
SHELTERS AND THE SLUMS, AND ALL THE TENEBROUS SPECTACLES OF ORDURE,
LOATHSOME FILTH AND WICKEDNESS.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN ONE DAY WHEN HORDES OF EMANCIPATED SLAVES COME FORTH
FROM THESE DENS OF MISERY TO SWOOP DOWN ON THEIR UNSUSPECTING FELLOW
MEN? FOR THIS OTHER WORLD DOES NOT THINK ABOUT SUCH A POSSIBILITY. THEY
HAVE ALLOWED THESE THINGS TO GO ON WITHOUT CARING AND EVEN WITHOUT
SUSPECTING--IN THEIR TOTAL LACK OF INSTINCTIVE UNDERSTANDING--THAT
SOONER OR LATER DESTINY WILL TAKE ITS VENGEANCE UNLESS IT WILL HAVE BEEN
APPEASED IN TIME.

TO-DAY I FERVIDLY THANK PROVIDENCE FOR HAVING SENT ME TO SUCH A SCHOOL.
THERE I COULD NOT REFUSE TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN MATTERS THAT DID NOT
PLEASE ME. THIS SCHOOL SOON TAUGHT ME A PROFOUND LESSON.

IN ORDER NOT TO DESPAIR COMPLETELY OF THE PEOPLE AMONG WHOM I THEN LIVED
I HAD TO SET ON ONE SIDE THE OUTWARD APPEARANCES OF THEIR LIVES AND ON
THE OTHER THE REASONS WHY THEY HAD DEVELOPED IN THAT WAY. THEN I COULD
HEAR EVERYTHING WITHOUT DISCOURAGEMENT; FOR THOSE WHO EMERGED FROM ALL
THIS MISFORTUNE AND MISERY, FROM THIS FILTH AND OUTWARD DEGRADATION,
WERE NOT HUMAN BEINGS AS SUCH BUT RATHER LAMENTABLE RESULTS OF
LAMENTABLE LAWS. IN MY OWN LIFE SIMILAR HARDSHIPS PREVENTED ME FROM
GIVING WAY TO A PITYING SENTIMENTALITY AT THE SIGHT OF THESE DEGRADED
PRODUCTS WHICH HAD FINALLY RESULTED FROM THE PRESSURE OF CIRCUMSTANCES.
NO, THE SENTIMENTAL ATTITUDE WOULD BE THE WRONG ONE TO ADOPT.

EVEN IN THOSE DAYS I ALREADY SAW THAT THERE WAS A TWO-FOLD METHOD BY
WHICH ALONE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO BRING ABOUT AN AMELIORATION OF THESE
CONDITIONS. THIS METHOD IS: FIRST, TO CREATE BETTER FUNDAMENTAL
CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT BY ESTABLISHING A PROFOUND FEELING FOR
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES AMONG THE PUBLIC; SECOND, TO COMBINE THIS
FEELING FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES WITH A RUTHLESS DETERMINATION TO
PRUNE AWAY ALL EXCRESCENCES WHICH ARE INCAPABLE OF BEING IMPROVED.

JUST AS NATURE CONCENTRATES ITS GREATEST ATTENTION, NOT TO THE
MAINTENANCE OF WHAT ALREADY EXISTS BUT ON THE SELECTIVE BREEDING OF
OFFSPRING IN ORDER TO CARRY ON THE SPECIES, SO IN HUMAN LIFE ALSO IT IS
LESS A MATTER OF ARTIFICIALLY IMPROVING THE EXISTING GENERATION--WHICH,
OWING TO HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS, IS IMPOSSIBLE IN NINETY-NINE CASES OUT
OF A HUNDRED--AND MORE A MATTER OF SECURING FROM THE VERY START A BETTER
ROAD FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.

DURING MY STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE IN VIENNA I PERCEIVED VERY CLEARLY THAT
THE AIM OF ALL SOCIAL ACTIVITY MUST NEVER BE MERELY CHARITABLE RELIEF,
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS AND USELESS, BUT IT MUST RATHER BE A MEANS TO FIND A
WAY OF ELIMINATING THE FUNDAMENTAL DEFICIENCIES IN OUR ECONOMIC AND
CULTURAL LIFE--DEFICIENCIES WHICH NECESSARILY BRING ABOUT THE
DEGRADATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR AT LEAST LEAD HIM TOWARDS SUCH
DEGRADATION. THE DIFFICULTY OF EMPLOYING EVERY MEANS, EVEN THE MOST
DRASTIC, TO ERADICATE THE HOSTILITY PREVAILING AMONG THE WORKING CLASSES
TOWARDS THE STATE IS LARGELY DUE TO AN ATTITUDE OF UNCERTAINTY IN
DECIDING UPON THE INNER MOTIVES AND CAUSES OF THIS CONTEMPORARY
PHENOMENON. THE GROUNDS OF THIS UNCERTAINTY ARE TO BE FOUND EXCLUSIVELY
IN THE SENSE OF GUILT WHICH EACH INDIVIDUAL FEELS FOR HAVING PERMITTED
THIS TRAGEDY OF DEGRADATION. FOR THAT FEELING PARALYSES EVERY EFFORT AT
MAKING A SERIOUS AND FIRM DECISION TO ACT. AND THUS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE
WHOM IT CONCERNS ARE VACILLATING THEY ARE TIMID AND HALF-HEARTED IN
PUTTING INTO EFFECT EVEN THE MEASURES WHICH ARE INDISPENSABLE FOR
SELF-PRESERVATION. WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL IS NO LONGER BURDENED WITH HIS
OWN CONSCIOUSNESS OF BLAME IN THIS REGARD, THEN AND ONLY THEN WILL HE
HAVE THAT INNER TRANQUILLITY AND OUTER FORCE TO CUT OFF DRASTICALLY AND
RUTHLESSLY ALL THE PARASITE GROWTH AND ROOT OUT THE WEEDS.

BUT BECAUSE THE AUSTRIAN STATE HAD ALMOST NO SENSE OF SOCIAL RIGHTS OR
SOCIAL LEGISLATION ITS INABILITY TO ABOLISH THOSE EVIL EXCRESCENCES WAS
MANIFEST.

I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT APPALLED ME MOST AT THAT TIME: THE
ECONOMIC MISERY OF THOSE WHO WERE THEN MY COMPANIONS, THEIR CRUDE
CUSTOMS AND MORALS, OR THE LOW LEVEL OF THEIR INTELLECTUAL CULTURE.

HOW OFTEN OUR BOURGEOISIE RISES UP IN MORAL INDIGNATION ON HEARING FROM
THE MOUTH OF SOME PITIABLE TRAMP THAT IT IS ALL THE SAME TO HIM WHETHER
HE BE A GERMAN OR NOT AND THAT HE WILL FIND HIMSELF AT HOME WHEREVER HE
CAN GET ENOUGH TO KEEP BODY AND SOUL TOGETHER. THEY PROTEST STERNLY
AGAINST SUCH A LACK OF 'NATIONAL PRIDE' AND STRONGLY EXPRESS THEIR
HORROR AT SUCH SENTIMENTS.

BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE REALLY ASK THEMSELVES WHY IT IS THAT THEIR OWN
SENTIMENTS ARE BETTER? HOW MANY OF THEM UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR NATURAL
PRIDE IN BEING MEMBERS OF SO FAVOURED A NATION ARISES FROM THE
INNUMERABLE SUCCESSION OF INSTANCES THEY HAVE ENCOUNTERED WHICH REMIND
THEM OF THE GREATNESS OF THE FATHERLAND AND THE NATION IN ALL SPHERES OF
ARTISTIC AND CULTURAL LIFE? HOW MANY OF THEM REALIZE THAT PRIDE IN THE
FATHERLAND IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON KNOWLEDGE OF ITS GREATNESS IN ALL
THOSE SPHERES? DO OUR BOURGEOIS CIRCLES EVER THINK WHAT A RIDICULOUSLY
MEAGRE SHARE THE PEOPLE HAVE IN THAT KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS A NECESSARY
PREREQUISITE FOR THE FEELING OF PRIDE IN ONE'S FATHERLAND?

IT CANNOT BE OBJECTED HERE THAT IN OTHER COUNTRIES SIMILAR CONDITIONS
EXIST AND THAT NEVERTHELESS THE WORKING CLASSES IN THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE
REMAINED PATRIOTIC. EVEN IF THAT WERE SO, IT WOULD BE NO EXCUSE FOR OUR
NEGLIGENT ATTITUDE. BUT IT IS NOT SO. WHAT WE CALL CHAUVINISTIC
EDUCATION--IN THE CASE OF THE FRENCH PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE--IS ONLY THE
EXCESSIVE EXALTATION OF THE GREATNESS OF FRANCE IN ALL SPHERES OF
CULTURE OR, AS THE FRENCH SAY, CIVILIZATION. THE FRENCH BOY IS NOT
EDUCATED ON PURELY OBJECTIVE PRINCIPLES. WHEREVER THE IMPORTANCE OF THE
POLITICAL AND CULTURAL GREATNESS OF HIS COUNTRY IS CONCERNED HE IS
TAUGHT IN THE MOST SUBJECTIVE WAY THAT ONE CAN IMAGINE.

THIS EDUCATION WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO BE CONFINED TO GENERAL IDEAS IN A
LARGE PERSPECTIVE AND THESE OUGHT TO BE DEEPLY ENGRAVEN, BY CONSTANT
REPETITION IF NECESSARY, ON THE MEMORIES AND FEELINGS OF THE PEOPLE.

IN OUR CASE, HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT MERELY GUILTY OF NEGATIVE SINS OF
OMISSION BUT ALSO OF POSITIVELY PERVERTING THE LITTLE WHICH SOME
INDIVIDUALS HAD THE LUCK TO LEARN AT SCHOOL. THE RATS THAT POISON OUR
BODY-POLITIC GNAW FROM THE HEARTS AND MEMORIES OF THE BROAD MASSES EVEN
THAT LITTLE WHICH DISTRESS AND MISERY HAVE LEFT.

LET THE READER TRY TO PICTURE THE FOLLOWING:

THERE IS A LODGING IN A CELLAR AND THIS LODGING CONSISTS OF TWO DAMP
ROOMS. IN THESE ROOMS A WORKMAN AND HIS FAMILY LIVE--SEVEN PEOPLE IN
ALL. LET US ASSUME THAT ONE OF THE CHILDREN IS A BOY OF THREE YEARS.
THAT IS THE AGE AT WHICH CHILDREN FIRST BECOME CONSCIOUS OF THE
IMPRESSIONS WHICH THEY RECEIVE. IN THE CASE OF HIGHLY GIFTED PEOPLE
TRACES OF THE IMPRESSIONS RECEIVED IN THOSE EARLY YEARS LAST IN THE
MEMORY UP TO AN ADVANCED AGE. NOW THE NARROWNESS AND CONGESTION OF THOSE
LIVING QUARTERS DO NOT CONDUCE TO PLEASANT INTER-RELATIONS. THUS
QUARRELS AND FITS OF MUTUAL ANGER ARISE. THESE PEOPLE CAN HARDLY BE SAID
TO LIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER, BUT RATHER DOWN ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER. THE
SMALL MISUNDERSTANDINGS WHICH DISAPPEAR OF THEMSELVES IN A HOME WHERE
THERE IS ENOUGH SPACE FOR PEOPLE TO GO APART FROM ONE ANOTHER FOR A
WHILE, HERE BECOME THE SOURCE OF CHRONIC DISPUTES. AS FAR AS THE
CHILDREN ARE CONCERNED THE SITUATION IS TOLERABLE FROM THIS POINT OF
VIEW. IN SUCH CONDITIONS THEY ARE CONSTANTLY QUARRELLING WITH ONE
ANOTHER, BUT THE QUARRELS ARE QUICKLY AND ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN. BUT WHEN
THE PARENTS FALL OUT WITH ONE ANOTHER THESE DAILY BICKERINGS OFTEN
DESCEND TO RUDENESS SUCH AS CANNOT BE ADEQUATELY IMAGINED. THE RESULTS
OF SUCH EXPERIENCES MUST BECOME APPARENT LATER ON IN THE CHILDREN. ONE
MUST HAVE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE OF SUCH A MILIEU SO AS TO BE ABLE TO
PICTURE THE STATE OF AFFAIRS THAT ARISES FROM THESE MUTUAL
RECRIMINATIONS WHEN THE FATHER PHYSICALLY ASSAULTS THE MOTHER AND
MALTREATS HER IN A FIT OF DRUNKEN RAGE. AT THE AGE OF SIX THE CHILD CAN
NO LONGER IGNORE THOSE SORDID DETAILS WHICH EVEN AN ADULT WOULD FIND
REVOLTING. INFECTED WITH MORAL POISON, BODILY UNDERNOURISHED, AND THE
POOR LITTLE HEAD FILLED WITH VERMIN, THE YOUNG 'CITIZEN' GOES TO THE
PRIMARY SCHOOL. WITH DIFFICULTY HE BARELY LEARNS TO READ AND WRITE.
THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF LEARNING ANY LESSONS AT HOME. QUITE THE
CONTRARY. THE FATHER AND MOTHER THEMSELVES TALK BEFORE THE CHILDREN IN
THE MOST DISPARAGING WAY ABOUT THE TEACHER AND THE SCHOOL AND THEY ARE
MUCH MORE INCLINED TO INSULT THE TEACHERS THAN TO PUT THEIR OFFSPRING
ACROSS THE KNEE AND KNOCK SOUND REASON INTO HIM. WHAT THE LITTLE FELLOW
HEARS AT HOME DOES NOT TEND TO INCREASE RESPECT FOR HIS HUMAN
SURROUNDINGS. HERE NOTHING GOOD IS SAID OF HUMAN NATURE AS A WHOLE AND
EVERY INSTITUTION, FROM THE SCHOOL TO THE GOVERNMENT, IS REVILED.
WHETHER RELIGION AND MORALS ARE CONCERNED OR THE STATE AND THE SOCIAL
ORDER, IT IS ALL THE SAME; THEY ARE ALL SCOFFED AT. WHEN THE YOUNG LAD
LEAVES SCHOOL, AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT
ARE THE MOST STRIKING FEATURES OF HIS CHARACTER, INCREDIBLE IGNORANCE IN
SO FAR AS REAL KNOWLEDGE IS CONCERNED OR CYNICAL IMPUDENCE COMBINED WITH
AN ATTITUDE TOWARDS MORALITY WHICH IS REALLY STARTLING AT SO YOUNG AN
AGE.

WHAT STATION IN LIFE CAN SUCH A PERSON FILL, TO WHOM NOTHING IS SACRED,
WHO HAS NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING NOBLE BUT, ON THE CONTRARY, HAS BEEN
INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH THE LOWEST KIND OF HUMAN EXISTENCE? THIS
CHILD OF THREE HAS GOT INTO THE HABIT OF REVILING ALL AUTHORITY BY THE
TIME HE IS FIFTEEN. HE HAS BEEN ACQUAINTED ONLY WITH MORAL FILTH AND
VILENESS, EVERYTHING BEING EXCLUDED THAT MIGHT STIMULATE HIS THOUGHT
TOWARDS HIGHER THINGS. AND NOW THIS YOUNG SPECIMEN OF HUMANITY ENTERS
THE SCHOOL OF LIFE.

HE LEADS THE SAME KIND OF LIFE WHICH WAS EXEMPLIFIED FOR HIM BY HIS
FATHER DURING HIS CHILDHOOD. HE LOITERS ABOUT AND COMES HOME AT ALL
HOURS. HE NOW EVEN BLACK-GUARDS THAT BROKEN-HEARTED BEING WHO GAVE HIM
BIRTH. HE CURSES GOD AND THE WORLD AND FINALLY ENDS UP IN A HOUSE OF
CORRECTION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. THERE HE GETS THE FINAL POLISH.

AND HIS BOURGEOIS CONTEMPORARIES ARE ASTONISHED AT THE LACK OF
'PATRIOTIC ENTHUSIASM' WHICH THIS YOUNG 'CITIZEN' MANIFESTS.

DAY AFTER DAY THE BOURGEOIS WORLD ARE WITNESSES TO THE PHENOMENON OF
SPREADING POISON AMONG THE PEOPLE THROUGH THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE
THEATRE AND THE CINEMA, GUTTER JOURNALISM AND OBSCENE BOOKS; AND YET
THEY ARE ASTONISHED AT THE DEPLORABLE 'MORAL STANDARDS' AND 'NATIONAL
INDIFFERENCE' OF THE MASSES. AS IF THE CINEMA BILGE AND THE GUTTER PRESS
AND SUCHLIKE COULD INCULCATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GREATNESS OF ONE'S
COUNTRY, APART ENTIRELY FROM THE EARLIER EDUCATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL.

I THEN CAME TO UNDERSTAND, QUICKLY AND THOROUGHLY, WHAT I HAD NEVER BEEN
AWARE OF BEFORE. IT WAS THE FOLLOWING:

THE QUESTION OF 'NATIONALIZING' A PEOPLE IS FIRST AND FOREMOST ONE OF
ESTABLISHING HEALTHY SOCIAL CONDITIONS WHICH WILL FURNISH THE GROUNDS
THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL. FOR ONLY WHEN
FAMILY UPBRINGING AND SCHOOL EDUCATION HAVE INCULCATED IN THE INDIVIDUAL
A KNOWLEDGE OF THE CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC AND, ABOVE ALL, THE POLITICAL
GREATNESS OF HIS OWN COUNTRY--THEN, AND THEN ONLY, WILL IT BE POSSIBLE
FOR HIM TO FEEL PROUD OF BEING A CITIZEN OF SUCH A COUNTRY. I CAN FIGHT
ONLY FOR SOMETHING THAT I LOVE. I CAN LOVE ONLY WHAT I RESPECT. AND IN
ORDER TO RESPECT A THING I MUST AT LEAST HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE OF IT.

AS SOON AS MY INTEREST IN SOCIAL QUESTIONS WAS ONCE AWAKENED I BEGAN TO
STUDY THEM IN A FUNDAMENTAL WAY. A NEW AND HITHERTO UNKNOWN WORLD WAS
THUS REVEALED TO ME.

IN THE YEARS 1909-10 I HAD SO FAR IMPROVED MY, POSITION THAT I NO LONGER
HAD TO EARN MY DAILY BREAD AS A MANUAL LABOURER. I WAS NOW WORKING
INDEPENDENTLY AS DRAUGHTSMAN, AND PAINTER IN WATER COLOURS. THIS MÃ‰TIER
WAS A POOR ONE INDEED AS FAR AS EARNINGS WERE CONCERNED; FOR THESE WERE
ONLY SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE BARE EXIGENCIES OF LIFE. YET IT HAD AN
INTEREST FOR ME IN VIEW OF THE PROFESSION TO WHICH I ASPIRED. MOREOVER,
WHEN I CAME HOME IN THE EVENINGS I WAS NOW NO LONGER DEAD-TIRED AS
FORMERLY, WHEN I USED TO BE UNABLE TO LOOK INTO A BOOK WITHOUT FALLING
ASLEEP ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. MY PRESENT OCCUPATION THEREFORE WAS IN LINE
WITH THE PROFESSION I AIMED AT FOR THE FUTURE. MOREOVER, I WAS MASTER OF
MY OWN TIME AND COULD DISTRIBUTE MY WORKING-HOURS NOW BETTER THAN
FORMERLY. I PAINTED IN ORDER TO EARN MY BREAD, AND I STUDIED BECAUSE I
LIKED IT.

THUS I WAS ABLE TO ACQUIRE THAT THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE SOCIAL
PROBLEM WHICH WAS A NECESSARY COMPLEMENT TO WHAT I WAS LEARNING THROUGH
ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. I STUDIED ALL THE BOOKS WHICH I COULD FIND THAT DEALT
WITH THIS QUESTION AND I THOUGHT DEEPLY ON WHAT I READ. I THINK THAT THE
MILIEU IN WHICH I THEN LIVED CONSIDERED ME AN ECCENTRIC PERSON.

BESIDES MY INTEREST IN THE SOCIAL QUESTION I NATURALLY DEVOTED MYSELF
WITH ENTHUSIASM TO THE STUDY OF ARCHITECTURE. SIDE BY SIDE WITH MUSIC, I
CONSIDERED IT QUEEN OF THE ARTS. TO STUDY IT WAS FOR ME NOT WORK BUT
PLEASURE. I COULD READ OR DRAW UNTIL THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
WITHOUT EVER GETTING TIRED. AND I BECAME MORE AND MORE CONFIDENT THAT MY
DREAM OF A BRILLIANT FUTURE WOULD BECOME TRUE, EVEN THOUGH I SHOULD HAVE
TO WAIT LONG YEARS FOR ITS FULFILMENT. I WAS FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT ONE
DAY I SHOULD MAKE A NAME FOR MYSELF AS AN ARCHITECT.

THE FACT THAT, SIDE BY SIDE WITH MY PROFESSIONAL STUDIES, I TOOK THE
GREATEST INTEREST IN EVERYTHING THAT HAD TO DO WITH POLITICS DID NOT
SEEM TO ME TO SIGNIFY ANYTHING OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. ON THE CONTRARY: I
LOOKED UPON THIS PRACTICAL INTEREST IN POLITICS MERELY AS PART OF AN
ELEMENTARY OBLIGATION THAT DEVOLVES ON EVERY THINKING MAN. THOSE WHO
HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OF THE POLITICAL WORLD AROUND THEM HAVE NO RIGHT
TO CRITICIZE OR COMPLAIN. ON POLITICAL QUESTIONS THEREFORE I STILL
CONTINUED TO READ AND STUDY A GREAT DEAL. BUT READING HAD PROBABLY A
DIFFERENT SIGNIFICANCE FOR ME FROM THAT WHICH IT HAS FOR THE AVERAGE RUN
OF OUR SO-CALLED 'INTELLECTUALS'.

I KNOW PEOPLE WHO READ INTERMINABLY, BOOK AFTER BOOK, FROM PAGE TO PAGE,
AND YET I SHOULD NOT CALL THEM 'WELL-READ PEOPLE'. OF COURSE THEY 'KNOW'
AN IMMENSE AMOUNT; BUT THEIR BRAIN SEEMS INCAPABLE OF ASSORTING AND
CLASSIFYING THE MATERIAL WHICH THEY HAVE GATHERED FROM BOOKS. THEY HAVE
NOT THE FACULTY OF DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN WHAT IS USEFUL AND USELESS IN
A BOOK; SO THAT THEY MAY RETAIN THE FORMER IN THEIR MINDS AND IF
POSSIBLE SKIP OVER THE LATTER WHILE READING IT, IF THAT BE NOT POSSIBLE,
THEN--WHEN ONCE READ--THROW IT OVERBOARD AS USELESS BALLAST. READING IS
NOT AN END IN ITSELF, BUT A MEANS TO AN END. ITS CHIEF PURPOSE IS TO
HELP TOWARDS FILLING IN THE FRAMEWORK WHICH IS MADE UP OF THE TALENTS
AND CAPABILITIES THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL POSSESSES. THUS EACH ONE PROCURES
FOR HIMSELF THE IMPLEMENTS AND MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR THE FULFILMENT OF
HIS CALLING IN LIFE, NO MATTER WHETHER THIS BE THE ELEMENTARY TASK OF
EARNING ONE'S DAILY BREAD OR A CALLING THAT RESPONDS TO HIGHER HUMAN
ASPIRATIONS. SUCH IS THE FIRST PURPOSE OF READING. AND THE SECOND
PURPOSE IS TO GIVE A GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE. IN
BOTH CASES, HOWEVER, THE MATERIAL WHICH ONE HAS ACQUIRED THROUGH READING
MUST NOT BE STORED UP IN THE MEMORY ON A PLAN THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE
SUCCESSIVE CHAPTERS OF THE BOOK; BUT EACH LITTLE PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE THUS
GAINED MUST BE TREATED AS IF IT WERE A LITTLE STONE TO BE INSERTED INTO
A MOSAIC, SO THAT IT FINDS ITS PROPER PLACE AMONG ALL THE OTHER PIECES
AND PARTICLES THAT HELP TO FORM A GENERAL WORLD-PICTURE IN THE BRAIN OF
THE READER. OTHERWISE ONLY A CONFUSED JUMBLE OF CHAOTIC NOTIONS WILL
RESULT FROM ALL THIS READING. THAT JUMBLE IS NOT MERELY USELESS, BUT IT
ALSO TENDS TO MAKE THE UNFORTUNATE POSSESSOR OF IT CONCEITED. FOR HE
SERIOUSLY CONSIDERS HIMSELF A WELL-EDUCATED PERSON AND THINKS THAT HE
UNDERSTANDS SOMETHING OF LIFE. HE BELIEVES THAT HE HAS ACQUIRED
KNOWLEDGE, WHEREAS THE TRUTH IS THAT EVERY INCREASE IN SUCH 'KNOWLEDGE'
DRAWS HIM MORE AND MORE AWAY FROM REAL LIFE, UNTIL HE FINALLY ENDS UP IN
SOME SANATORIUM OR TAKES TO POLITICS AND BECOMES A PARLIAMENTARY DEPUTY.

SUCH A PERSON NEVER SUCCEEDS IN TURNING HIS KNOWLEDGE TO PRACTICAL
ACCOUNT WHEN THE OPPORTUNE MOMENT ARRIVES; FOR HIS MENTAL EQUIPMENT IS
NOT ORDERED WITH A VIEW TO MEETING THE DEMANDS OF EVERYDAY LIFE. HIS
KNOWLEDGE IS STORED IN HIS BRAIN AS A LITERAL TRANSCRIPT OF THE BOOKS HE
HAS READ AND THE ORDER OF SUCCESSION IN WHICH HE HAS READ THEM. AND IF
FATE SHOULD ONE DAY CALL UPON HIM TO USE SOME OF HIS BOOK-KNOWLEDGE FOR
CERTAIN PRACTICAL ENDS IN LIFE THAT VERY CALL WILL HAVE TO NAME THE BOOK
AND GIVE THE NUMBER OF THE PAGE; FOR THE POOR NOODLE HIMSELF WOULD NEVER
BE ABLE TO FIND THE SPOT WHERE HE GATHERED THE INFORMATION NOW CALLED
FOR. BUT IF THE PAGE IS NOT MENTIONED AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT THE
WIDELY-READ INTELLECTUAL WILL FIND HIMSELF IN A STATE OF HOPELESS
EMBARRASSMENT. IN A HIGH STATE OF AGITATION HE SEARCHES FOR ANALOGOUS
CASES AND IT IS ALMOST A DEAD CERTAINTY THAT HE WILL FINALLY DELIVER THE
WRONG PRESCRIPTION.

IF THAT IS NOT A CORRECT DESCRIPTION, THEN HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN THE
POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF OUR PARLIAMENTARY HEROES WHO HOLD THE HIGHEST
POSITIONS IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY? OTHERWISE WE SHOULD HAVE TO
ATTRIBUTE THE DOINGS OF SUCH POLITICAL LEADERS, NOT TO PATHOLOGICAL
CONDITIONS BUT SIMPLY TO MALICE AND CHICANERY.

ON THE OTHER HAND, ONE WHO HAS CULTIVATED THE ART OF READING WILL
INSTANTLY DISCERN, IN A BOOK OR JOURNAL OR PAMPHLET, WHAT OUGHT TO BE
REMEMBERED BECAUSE IT MEETS ONE'S PERSONAL NEEDS OR IS OF VALUE AS
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE. WHAT HE THUS LEARNS IS INCORPORATED IN HIS MENTAL
ANALOGUE OF THIS OR THAT PROBLEM OR THING, FURTHER CORRECTING THE MENTAL
PICTURE OR ENLARGING IT SO THAT IT BECOMES MORE EXACT AND PRECISE.
SHOULD SOME PRACTICAL PROBLEM SUDDENLY DEMAND EXAMINATION OR SOLUTION,
MEMORY WILL IMMEDIATELY SELECT THE OPPORTUNE INFORMATION FROM THE MASS
THAT HAS BEEN ACQUIRED THROUGH YEARS OF READING AND WILL PLACE THIS
INFORMATION AT THE SERVICE OF ONE'S POWERS OF JUDGMENT SO AS TO GET A
NEW AND CLEARER VIEW OF THE PROBLEM IN QUESTION OR PRODUCE A DEFINITIVE
SOLUTION.

ONLY THUS CAN READING HAVE ANY MEANING OR BE WORTH WHILE.

THE SPEAKER, FOR EXAMPLE, WHO HAS NOT THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION READY
TO HAND WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO A PROPER TREATMENT OF HIS SUBJECT IS
UNABLE TO DEFEND HIS OPINIONS AGAINST AN OPPONENT, EVEN THOUGH THOSE
OPINIONS BE PERFECTLY SOUND AND TRUE. IN EVERY DISCUSSION HIS MEMORY
WILL LEAVE HIM SHAMEFULLY IN THE LURCH. HE CANNOT SUMMON UP ARGUMENTS TO
SUPPORT HIS STATEMENTS OR TO REFUTE HIS OPPONENT. SO LONG AS THE SPEAKER
HAS ONLY TO DEFEND HIMSELF ON HIS OWN PERSONAL ACCOUNT, THE SITUATION IS
NOT SERIOUS; BUT THE EVIL COMES WHEN CHANCE PLACES AT THE HEAD OF PUBLIC
AFFAIRS SUCH A SOI-DISANT KNOW-IT-ALL, WHO IN REALITY KNOWS NOTHING.

FROM EARLY YOUTH I ENDEAVOURED TO READ BOOKS IN THE RIGHT WAY AND I WAS
FORTUNATE IN HAVING A GOOD MEMORY AND INTELLIGENCE TO ASSIST ME. FROM
THAT POINT OF VIEW MY SOJOURN IN VIENNA WAS PARTICULARLY USEFUL AND
PROFITABLE. MY EXPERIENCES OF EVERYDAY LIFE THERE WERE A CONSTANT
STIMULUS TO STUDY THE MOST DIVERSE PROBLEMS FROM NEW ANGLES. INASMUCH AS
I WAS IN A POSITION TO PUT THEORY TO THE TEST OF REALITY AND REALITY TO
THE TEST OF THEORY, I WAS SAFE FROM THE DANGER OF PEDANTIC THEORIZING ON
THE ONE HAND AND, ON THE OTHER, FROM BEING TOO IMPRESSED BY THE
SUPERFICIAL ASPECTS OF REALITY.

THE EXPERIENCE OF EVERYDAY LIFE AT THAT TIME DETERMINED ME TO MAKE A
FUNDAMENTAL THEORETICAL STUDY OF TWO MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OUTSIDE OF
THE SOCIAL QUESTION.

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHEN I MIGHT HAVE STARTED TO MAKE A THOROUGH
STUDY OF THE DOCTRINE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF MARXISM WERE IT NOT FOR THE
FACT THAT I THEN LITERALLY RAN HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE PROBLEM.

WHAT I KNEW OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY IN MY YOUTH WAS PRECIOUS LITTLE AND THAT
LITTLE WAS FOR THE MOST PART WRONG. THE FACT THAT IT LED THE STRUGGLE
FOR UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE AND THE SECRET BALLOT GAVE ME AN INNER
SATISFACTION; FOR MY REASON THEN TOLD ME THAT THIS WOULD WEAKEN THE
HABSBURG REGIME, WHICH I SO THOROUGHLY DETESTED. I WAS CONVINCED THAT
EVEN IF IT SHOULD SACRIFICE THE GERMAN ELEMENT THE DANUBIAN STATE COULD
NOT CONTINUE TO EXIST. EVEN AT THE PRICE OF A LONG AND SLOW SLAVIZ-ATION
OF THE AUSTRIAN GERMANS THE STATE WOULD SECURE NO GUARANTEE OF A REALLY
DURABLE EMPIRE; BECAUSE IT WAS VERY QUESTIONABLE IF AND HOW FAR THE
SLAVS POSSESSED THE NECESSARY CAPACITY FOR CONSTRUCTIVE POLITICS.
THEREFORE I WELCOMED EVERY MOVEMENT THAT MIGHT LEAD TOWARDS THE FINAL
DISRUPTION OF THAT IMPOSSIBLE STATE WHICH HAD DECREED THAT IT WOULD
STAMP OUT THE GERMAN CHARACTER IN TEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. THE MORE THIS
BABEL OF TONGUES WROUGHT DISCORD AND DISRUPTION, EVEN IN THE PARLIAMENT,
THE NEARER THE HOUR APPROACHED FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF THIS BABYLONIAN
EMPIRE. THAT WOULD MEAN THE LIBERATION OF MY GERMAN AUSTRIAN PEOPLE, AND
ONLY THEN WOULD IT BECOME POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO BE RE-UNITED TO THE
MOTHERLAND.

ACCORDINGLY I HAD NO FEELINGS OF ANTIPATHY TOWARDS THE ACTUAL POLICY OF
THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS. THAT ITS AVOWED PURPOSE WAS TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF
THE WORKING CLASSES--WHICH IN MY IGNORANCE I THEN FOOLISHLY
BELIEVED--WAS A FURTHER REASON WHY I SHOULD SPEAK IN FAVOUR OF SOCIAL
DEMOCRACY RATHER THAN AGAINST IT. BUT THE FEATURES THAT CONTRIBUTED MOST
TO ESTRANGE ME FROM THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT WAS ITS HOSTILE
ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE STRUGGLE FOR THE CONSERVATION OF GERMANISM IN
AUSTRIA, ITS LAMENTABLE COCOTTING WITH THE SLAV 'COMRADES', WHO RECEIVED
THESE APPROACHES FAVOURABLY AS LONG AS ANY PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES WERE
FORTHCOMING BUT OTHERWISE MAINTAINED A HAUGHTY RESERVE, THUS GIVING THE
IMPORTUNATE MENDICANTS THE SORT OF ANSWER THEIR BEHAVIOUR DESERVED.

AND SO AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN THE WORD 'MARXISM' WAS VERY LITTLE KNOWN
TO ME, WHILE I LOOKED ON 'SOCIAL DEMOCRACY' AND 'SOCIALISM' AS
SYNONYMOUS EXPRESSIONS. IT WAS ONLY AS THE RESULT OF A SUDDEN BLOW FROM
THE ROUGH HAND OF FATE THAT MY EYES WERE OPENED TO THE NATURE OF THIS
UNPARALLELED SYSTEM FOR DUPING THE PUBLIC.

HITHERTO MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY WAS ONLY THAT
OF A MERE SPECTATOR AT SOME OF THEIR MASS MEETINGS. I HAD NOT THE
SLIGHTEST IDEA OF THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC TEACHING OR THE MENTALITY OF ITS
PARTISANS. ALL OF A SUDDEN I WAS BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH THE PRODUCTS
OF THEIR TEACHING AND WHAT THEY CALLED THEIR WELTANSCHAUUNG. IN THIS
WAY A FEW MONTHS SUFFICED FOR ME TO LEARN SOMETHING WHICH UNDER OTHER
CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT HAVE NECESSITATED DECADES OF STUDY--NAMELY, THAT
UNDER THE CLOAK OF SOCIAL VIRTUE AND LOVE OF ONE'S NEIGHBOUR A VERITABLE
PESTILENCE WAS SPREADING ABROAD AND THAT IF THIS PESTILENCE BE NOT
STAMPED OUT OF THE WORLD WITHOUT DELAY IT MAY EVENTUALLY SUCCEED IN
EXTERMINATING THE HUMAN RACE.

I FIRST CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS WHILE WORKING IN THE
BUILDING TRADE.

FROM THE VERY TIME THAT I STARTED WORK THE SITUATION WAS NOT VERY
PLEASANT FOR ME. MY CLOTHES WERE STILL RATHER DECENT. I WAS CAREFUL OF
MY SPEECH AND I WAS RESERVED IN MANNER. I WAS SO OCCUPIED WITH THINKING
OF MY OWN PRESENT LOT AND FUTURE POSSIBILITIES THAT I DID NOT TAKE MUCH
OF AN INTEREST IN MY IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS. I HAD SOUGHT WORK SO THAT I
SHOULDN'T STARVE AND AT THE SAME TIME SO AS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE FURTHER
HEADWAY WITH MY STUDIES, THOUGH THIS HEADWAY MIGHT BE SLOW. POSSIBLY I
SHOULD NOT HAVE BOTHERED TO BE INTERESTED IN MY COMPANIONS WERE IT NOT
THAT ON THE THIRD OR FOURTH DAY AN EVENT OCCURRED WHICH FORCED ME TO
TAKE A DEFINITE STAND. I WAS ORDERED TO JOIN THE TRADE UNION.

AT THAT TIME I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE TRADES UNIONS. I HAD HAD NO
OPPORTUNITY OF FORMING AN OPINION ON THEIR UTILITY OR INUTILITY, AS THE
CASE MIGHT BE. BUT WHEN I WAS TOLD THAT I MUST JOIN THE UNION I REFUSED.
THE GROUNDS WHICH I GAVE FOR MY REFUSAL WERE SIMPLY THAT I KNEW NOTHING
ABOUT THE MATTER AND THAT ANYHOW I WOULD NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO BE FORCED
INTO ANYTHING. PROBABLY THE FORMER REASON SAVED ME FROM BEING THROWN OUT
RIGHT AWAY. THEY PROBABLY THOUGHT THAT WITHIN A FEW DAYS I MIGHT BE
CONVERTED' AND BECOME MORE DOCILE. BUT IF THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE
PROFOUNDLY MISTAKEN. AFTER TWO WEEKS I FOUND IT UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR
ME TO TAKE SUCH A STEP, EVEN IF I HAD BEEN WILLING TO TAKE IT AT FIRST.
DURING THOSE FOURTEEN DAYS I CAME TO KNOW MY FELLOW WORKMEN BETTER, AND
NO POWER IN THE WORLD COULD HAVE MOVED ME TO JOIN AN ORGANIZATION WHOSE
REPRESENTATIVES HAD MEANWHILE SHOWN THEMSELVES IN A LIGHT WHICH I FOUND
SO UNFAVOURABLE.

DURING THE FIRST DAYS MY RESENTMENT WAS AROUSED.

AT MIDDAY SOME OF MY FELLOW WORKERS USED TO ADJOURN TO THE NEAREST
TAVERN, WHILE THE OTHERS REMAINED ON THE BUILDING PREMISES AND THERE ATE
THEIR MIDDAY MEAL, WHICH IN MOST CASES WAS A VERY SCANTY ONE. THESE WERE
MARRIED MEN. THEIR WIVES BROUGHT THEM THE MIDDAY SOUP IN DILAPIDATED
VESSELS. TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEK THERE WAS A GRADUAL INCREASE IN THE
NUMBER OF THOSE WHO REMAINED TO EAT THEIR MIDDAY MEAL ON THE BUILDING
PREMISES. I UNDERSTOOD THE REASON FOR THIS AFTERWARDS. THEY NOW TALKED
POLITICS.

I DRANK MY BOTTLE OF MILK AND ATE MY MORSEL OF BREAD SOMEWHERE ON THE
OUTSKIRTS, WHILE I CIRCUMSPECTLY STUDIED MY ENVIRONMENT OR ELSE FELL TO
MEDITATING ON MY OWN HARSH LOT. YET I HEARD MORE THAN ENOUGH. AND I
OFTEN THOUGHT THAT SOME OF WHAT THEY SAID WAS MEANT FOR MY EARS, IN THE
HOPE OF BRINGING ME TO A DECISION. BUT ALL THAT I HEARD HAD THE EFFECT
OF AROUSING THE STRONGEST ANTAGONISM IN ME. EVERYTHING WAS
DISPARAGED--THE NATION, BECAUSE IT WAS HELD TO BE AN INVENTION OF THE
'CAPITALIST' CLASS (HOW OFTEN I HAD TO LISTEN TO THAT PHRASE!); THE
FATHERLAND, BECAUSE IT WAS HELD TO BE AN INSTRUMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE
BOURGEOISIE FOR THE EXPLOITATION OF' THE WORKING MASSES; THE AUTHORITY
OF THE LAW, BECAUSE THAT WAS A MEANS OF HOLDING DOWN THE PROLETARIAT;
RELIGION, AS A MEANS OF DOPING THE PEOPLE, SO AS TO EXPLOIT THEM
AFTERWARDS; MORALITY, AS A BADGE OF STUPID AND SHEEPISH DOCILITY. THERE
WAS NOTHING THAT THEY DID NOT DRAG IN THE MUD.

AT FIRST I REMAINED SILENT; BUT THAT COULD NOT LAST VERY LONG. THEN I
BEGAN TO TAKE PART IN THE DISCUSSION AND TO REPLY TO THEIR STATEMENTS. I
HAD TO RECOGNIZE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS WAS BOUND TO BE ENTIRELY FRUITLESS,
AS LONG AS I DID NOT HAVE AT LEAST A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DEFINITE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE DISCUSSED. SO I DECIDED TO
CONSULT THE SOURCE FROM WHICH MY INTERLOCUTORS CLAIMED TO HAVE DRAWN
THEIR SO-CALLED WISDOM. I DEVOURED BOOK AFTER BOOK, PAMPHLET AFTER
PAMPHLET.

MEANWHILE, WE ARGUED WITH ONE ANOTHER ON THE BUILDING PREMISES. FROM DAY
TO DAY I WAS BECOMING BETTER INFORMED THAN MY COMPANIONS IN THE SUBJECTS
ON WHICH THEY CLAIMED TO BE EXPERTS. THEN A DAY CAME WHEN THE MORE
REDOUBTABLE OF MY ADVERSARIES RESORTED TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPON THEY
HAD TO REPLACE THE FORCE OF REASON. THIS WAS INTIMIDATION AND PHYSICAL
FORCE. SOME OF THE LEADERS AMONG MY ADVERSARIES ORDERED ME TO LEAVE THE
BUILDING OR ELSE GET FLUNG DOWN FROM THE SCAFFOLDING. AS I WAS QUITE
ALONE I COULD NOT PUT UP ANY PHYSICAL RESISTANCE; SO I CHOSE THE FIRST
ALTERNATIVE AND DEPARTED, RICHER HOWEVER BY AN EXPERIENCE.

I WENT AWAY FULL OF DISGUST; BUT AT THE SAME TIME SO DEEPLY MOVED THAT
IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TURN MY BACK ON THE WHOLE SITUATION
AND THINK NO MORE ABOUT IT. WHEN MY ANGER BEGAN TO CALM DOWN THE SPIRIT
OF OBSTINACY GOT THE UPPER HAND AND I DECIDED THAT AT ALL COSTS I WOULD
GET BACK TO WORK AGAIN IN THE BUILDING TRADE. THIS DECISION BECAME ALL
THE STRONGER A FEW WEEKS LATER, WHEN MY LITTLE SAVINGS HAD ENTIRELY RUN
OUT AND HUNGER CLUTCHED ME ONCE AGAIN IN ITS MERCILESS ARMS. NO
ALTERNATIVE WAS LEFT TO ME. I GOT WORK AGAIN AND HAD TO LEAVE IT FOR THE
SAME REASONS AS BEFORE.

THEN I ASKED MYSELF: ARE THESE MEN WORTHY OF BELONGING TO A GREAT
PEOPLE? THE QUESTION WAS PROFOUNDLY DISTURBING; FOR IF THE ANSWER WERE
'YES', THEN THE STRUGGLE TO DEFEND ONE'S NATIONALITY IS NO LONGER WORTH
ALL THE TROUBLE AND SACRIFICE WE DEMAND OF OUR BEST ELEMENTS IF IT BE IN
THE INTERESTS OF SUCH A RABBLE. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THE ANSWER HAD TO
BE 'NO--THESE MEN ARE NOT WORTHY OF THE NATION', THEN OUR NATION IS POOR
INDEED IN MEN. DURING THOSE DAYS OF MENTAL ANGUISH AND DEEP MEDITATION I
SAW BEFORE MY MIND THE EVER-INCREASING AND MENACING ARMY OF PEOPLE WHO
COULD NO LONGER BE RECKONED AS BELONGING TO THEIR OWN NATION.

IT WAS WITH QUITE A DIFFERENT FEELING, SOME DAYS LATER, THAT I GAZED ON
THE INTERMINABLE RANKS, FOUR ABREAST, OF VIENNESE WORKMEN PARADING AT A
MASS DEMONSTRATION. I STOOD DUMBFOUNDED FOR ALMOST TWO HOURS, WATCHING
THAT ENORMOUS HUMAN DRAGON WHICH SLOWLY UNCOILED ITSELF THERE BEFORE ME.
WHEN I FINALLY LEFT THE SQUARE AND WANDERED IN THE DIRECTION OF MY
LODGINGS I FELT DISMAYED AND DEPRESSED. ON MY WAY I NOTICED THE
ARBEITERZEITUNG (THE WORKMAN'S JOURNAL) IN A TOBACCO SHOP. THIS WAS THE
CHIEF PRESS-ORGAN OF THE OLD AUSTRIAN SOCIAL DEMOCRACY. IN A CHEAP CAFÃ©,
WHERE THE COMMON PEOPLE USED TO FOREGATHER AND WHERE I OFTEN WENT TO
READ THE PAPERS, THE ARBEITERZEITUNG WAS ALSO DISPLAYED. BUT HITHERTO I
COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO DO MORE THAN GLANCE AT THE WRETCHED THING FOR
A COUPLE OF MINUTES: FOR ITS WHOLE TONE WAS A SORT OF MENTAL VITRIOL TO
ME. UNDER THE DEPRESSING INFLUENCE OF THE DEMONSTRATION I HAD WITNESSED,
SOME INTERIOR VOICE URGED ME TO BUY THE PAPER IN THAT TOBACCO SHOP AND
READ IT THROUGH. SO I BROUGHT IT HOME WITH ME AND SPENT THE WHOLE
EVENING READING IT, DESPITE THE STEADILY MOUNTING RAGE PROVOKED BY THIS
CEASELESS OUTPOURING OF FALSEHOODS.

I NOW FOUND THAT IN THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC DAILY PAPERS I COULD STUDY THE
INNER CHARACTER OF THIS POLITICO-PHILOSOPHIC SYSTEM MUCH BETTER THAN IN
ALL THEIR THEORETICAL LITERATURE.

FOR THERE WAS A STRIKING DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE TWO. IN THE LITERARY
EFFUSIONS WHICH DEALT WITH THE THEORY OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY THERE WAS A
DISPLAY OF HIGH-SOUNDING PHRASEOLOGY ABOUT LIBERTY AND HUMAN DIGNITY AND
BEAUTY, ALL PROMULGATED WITH AN AIR OF PROFOUND WISDOM AND SERENE
PROPHETIC ASSURANCE; A METICULOUSLY-WOVEN GLITTER OF WORDS TO DAZZLE AND
MISLEAD THE READER. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE DAILY PRESS INCULCATED THIS
NEW DOCTRINE OF HUMAN REDEMPTION IN THE MOST BRUTAL FASHION. NO MEANS
WERE TOO BASE, PROVIDED THEY COULD BE EXPLOITED IN THE CAMPAIGN OF
SLANDER. THESE JOURNALISTS WERE REAL VIRTUOSOS IN THE ART OF TWISTING
FACTS AND PRESENTING THEM IN A DECEPTIVE FORM. THE THEORETICAL
LITERATURE WAS INTENDED FOR THE SIMPLETONS OF THE SOI-DISANT
INTELLECTUALS BELONGING TO THE MIDDLE AND, NATURALLY, THE UPPER CLASSES.
THE NEWSPAPER PROPAGANDA WAS INTENDED FOR THE MASSES.

THIS PROBING INTO BOOKS AND NEWSPAPERS AND STUDYING THE TEACHINGS OF
SOCIAL DEMOCRACY REAWAKENED MY LOVE FOR MY OWN PEOPLE. AND THUS WHAT AT
FIRST SEEMED AN IMPASSABLE CHASM BECAME THE OCCASION OF A CLOSER
AFFECTION.

HAVING ONCE UNDERSTOOD THE WORKING OF THE COLOSSAL SYSTEM FOR POISONING
THE POPULAR MIND, ONLY A FOOL COULD BLAME THE VICTIMS OF IT. DURING THE
YEARS THAT FOLLOWED I BECAME MORE INDEPENDENT AND, AS I DID SO, I BECAME
BETTER ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE INNER CAUSE OF THE SUCCESS ACHIEVED BY
THIS SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC GOSPEL. I NOW REALIZED THE MEANING AND PURPOSE OF
THOSE BRUTAL ORDERS WHICH PROHIBITED THE READING OF ALL BOOKS AND
NEWSPAPERS THAT WERE NOT 'RED' AND AT THE SAME TIME DEMANDED THAT ONLY
THE 'RED' MEETINGS SHOULD BE ATTENDED. IN THE CLEAR LIGHT OF BRUTAL
REALITY I WAS ABLE TO SEE WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE INEVITABLE
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT INTOLERANT TEACHING.

THE PSYCHE OF THE BROAD MASSES IS ACCESSIBLE ONLY TO WHAT IS STRONG AND
UNCOMPROMISING. LIKE A WOMAN WHOSE INNER SENSIBILITIES ARE NOT SO MUCH
UNDER THE SWAY OF ABSTRACT REASONING BUT ARE ALWAYS SUBJECT TO THE
INFLUENCE OF A VAGUE EMOTIONAL LONGING FOR THE STRENGTH THAT COMPLETES
HER BEING, AND WHO WOULD RATHER BOW TO THE STRONG MAN THAN DOMINATE THE
WEAKLING--IN LIKE MANNER THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE PREFER THE RULER TO
THE SUPPLIANT AND ARE FILLED WITH A STRONGER SENSE OF MENTAL SECURITY BY
A TEACHING THAT BROOKS NO RIVAL THAN BY A TEACHING WHICH OFFERS THEM A
LIBERAL CHOICE. THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE IDEA OF HOW TO MAKE SUCH A CHOICE
AND THUS THEY ARE PRONE TO FEEL THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABANDONED. THEY FEEL
VERY LITTLE SHAME AT BEING TERRORIZED INTELLECTUALLY AND THEY ARE
SCARCELY CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THEIR FREEDOM AS HUMAN BEINGS IS
IMPUDENTLY ABUSED; AND THUS THEY HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF THE
INTRINSIC FALLACY OF THE WHOLE DOCTRINE. THEY SEE ONLY THE RUTHLESS
FORCE AND BRUTALITY OF ITS DETERMINED UTTERANCES, TO WHICH THEY ALWAYS
SUBMIT.

IF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY SHOULD BE OPPOSED BY A MORE TRUTHFUL TEACHING, THEN
EVEN, THOUGH THE STRUGGLE BE OF THE BITTEREST KIND, THIS TRUTHFUL
TEACHING WILL FINALLY PREVAIL PROVIDED IT BE ENFORCED WITH EQUAL
RUTHLESSNESS.

WITHIN LESS THAN TWO YEARS I HAD GAINED A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIAL
DEMOCRACY, IN ITS TEACHING AND THE TECHNIQUE OF ITS OPERATIONS.

I RECOGNIZED THE INFAMY OF THAT TECHNIQUE WHEREBY THE MOVEMENT CARRIED
ON A CAMPAIGN OF MENTAL TERRORISM AGAINST THE BOURGEOISIE, WHO ARE
NEITHER MORALLY NOR SPIRITUALLY EQUIPPED TO WITHSTAND SUCH ATTACKS. THE
TACTICS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY CONSISTED IN OPENING, AT A GIVEN SIGNAL, A
VERITABLE DRUM-FIRE OF LIES AND CALUMNIES AGAINST THE MAN WHOM THEY
BELIEVED TO BE THE MOST REDOUBTABLE OF THEIR ADVERSARIES, UNTIL THE
NERVES OF THE LATTER GAVE WAY AND THEY SACRIFICED THE MAN WHO WAS
ATTACKED, SIMPLY IN THE HOPE OF BEING ALLOWED TO LIVE IN PEACE. BUT THE
HOPE PROVED ALWAYS TO BE A FOOLISH ONE, FOR THEY WERE NEVER LEFT IN
PEACE.

THE SAME TACTICS ARE REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN, UNTIL FEAR OF THESE MAD
DOGS EXERCISES, THROUGH SUGGESTION, A PARALYSING EFFECT ON THEIR
VICTIMS.

THROUGH ITS OWN EXPERIENCE SOCIAL DEMOCRACY LEARNED THE VALUE OF
STRENGTH, AND FOR THAT REASON IT ATTACKS MOSTLY THOSE IN WHOM IT SCENTS
STUFF OF THE MORE STALWART KIND, WHICH IS INDEED A VERY RARE POSSESSION.
ON THE OTHER HAND IT PRAISES EVERY WEAKLING AMONG ITS ADVERSARIES, MORE
OR LESS CAUTIOUSLY, ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE OF HIS MENTAL QUALITIES
KNOWN OR PRESUMED. THEY HAVE LESS FEAR OF A MAN OF GENIUS WHO LACKS
WILL-POWER THAN OF A VIGOROUS CHARACTER WITH MEDIOCRE INTELLIGENCE AND
AT THE SAME TIME THEY HIGHLY COMMEND THOSE WHO ARE DEVOID OF
INTELLIGENCE AND WILL-POWER.

THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS KNOW HOW TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY ALONE
ARE THE PROTECTORS OF PEACE. IN THIS WAY, ACTING VERY CIRCUMSPECTLY BUT
NEVER LOSING SIGHT OF THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL, THEY CONQUER ONE POSITION
AFTER ANOTHER, AT ONE TIME BY METHODS OF QUIET INTIMIDATION AND AT
ANOTHER TIME BY SHEER DAYLIGHT ROBBERY, EMPLOYING THESE LATTER TACTICS
AT THOSE MOMENTS WHEN PUBLIC ATTENTION IS TURNED TOWARDS OTHER MATTERS
FROM WHICH IT DOES NOT WISH TO BE DIVERTED, OR WHEN THE PUBLIC CONSIDERS
AN INCIDENT TOO TRIVIAL TO CREATE A SCANDAL ABOUT IT AND THUS PROVOKE
THE ANGER OF A MALIGNANT OPPONENT.

THESE TACTICS ARE BASED ON AN ACCURATE ESTIMATION OF HUMAN FRAILTIES AND
MUST LEAD TO SUCCESS, WITH ALMOST MATHEMATICAL CERTAINTY, UNLESS THE
OTHER SIDE ALSO LEARNS HOW TO FIGHT POISON GAS WITH POISON GAS. THE
WEAKER NATURES MUST BE TOLD THAT HERE IT IS A CASE OF TO BE OR NOT TO
BE.

I ALSO CAME TO UNDERSTAND THAT PHYSICAL INTIMIDATION HAS ITS
SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE MASS AS WELL AS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL. HERE AGAIN THE
SOCIALISTS HAD CALCULATED ACCURATELY ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT.

INTIMIDATION IN WORKSHOPS AND IN FACTORIES, IN ASSEMBLY HALLS AND AT
MASS DEMONSTRATIONS, WILL ALWAYS MEET WITH SUCCESS AS LONG AS IT DOES
NOT HAVE TO ENCOUNTER THE SAME KIND OF TERROR IN A STRONGER FORM.

THEN OF COURSE THE PARTY WILL RAISE A HORRIFIED OUTCRY, YELLING BLUE
MURDER AND APPEALING TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE, WHICH THEY HAVE JUST
REPUDIATED. IN DOING THIS THEIR AIM GENERALLY IS TO ADD TO THE GENERAL
CONFUSION, SO THAT THEY MAY HAVE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY OF REACHING THEIR
OWN GOAL UNOBSERVED. THEIR IDEA IS TO FIND AMONG THE HIGHER GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS SOME BOVINE CREATURE WHO, IN THE STUPID HOPE THAT HE MAY WIN
THE GOOD GRACES OF THESE AWE-INSPIRING OPPONENTS SO THAT THEY MAY
REMEMBER HIM IN CASE OF FUTURE EVENTUALITIES, WILL HELP THEM NOW TO
BREAK ALL THOSE WHO MAY OPPOSE THIS WORLD PEST.

THE IMPRESSION WHICH SUCH SUCCESSFUL TACTICS MAKE ON THE MINDS OF THE
BROAD MASSES, WHETHER THEY BE ADHERENTS OR OPPONENTS, CAN BE ESTIMATED
ONLY BY ONE WHO KNOWS THE POPULAR MIND, NOT FROM BOOKS BUT FROM
PRACTICAL LIFE. FOR THE SUCCESSES WHICH ARE THUS OBTAINED ARE TAKEN BY
THE ADHERENTS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY AS A TRIUMPHANT SYMBOL OF THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THEIR OWN CAUSE; ON THE OTHER HAND THE BEATEN OPPONENT
VERY OFTEN LOSES FAITH IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY FURTHER RESISTANCE.

THE MORE I UNDERSTOOD THE METHODS OF PHYSICAL INTIMIDATION THAT WERE
EMPLOYED, THE MORE SYMPATHY I HAD FOR THE MULTITUDE THAT HAD SUCCUMBED
TO IT.

I AM THANKFUL NOW FOR THE ORDEAL WHICH I HAD TO GO THROUGH AT THAT TIME;
FOR IT WAS THE MEANS OF BRINGING ME TO THINK KINDLY AGAIN OF MY OWN
PEOPLE, INASMUCH AS THE EXPERIENCE ENABLED ME TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE
FALSE LEADERS AND THE VICTIMS WHO HAVE BEEN LED ASTRAY.

WE MUST LOOK UPON THE LATTER SIMPLY AS VICTIMS. I HAVE JUST NOW TRIED TO
DEPICT A FEW TRAITS WHICH EXPRESS THE MENTALITY OF THOSE ON THE LOWEST
RUNG OF THE SOCIAL LADDER; BUT MY PICTURE WOULD BE DISPROPORTIONATE IF I
DO NOT ADD THAT AMID THE SOCIAL DEPTHS I STILL FOUND LIGHT; FOR I
EXPERIENCED A RARE SPIRIT OF SELF-SACRIFICE AND LOYAL COMRADESHIP AMONG
THOSE MEN, WHO DEMANDED LITTLE FROM LIFE AND WERE CONTENT AMID THEIR
MODEST SURROUNDINGS. THIS WAS TRUE ESPECIALLY OF THE OLDER GENERATION OF
WORKMEN. AND ALTHOUGH THESE QUALITIES WERE DISAPPEARING MORE AND MORE IN
THE YOUNGER GENERATION, OWING TO THE ALL-PERVADING INFLUENCE OF THE BIG
CITY, YET AMONG THE YOUNGER GENERATION ALSO THERE WERE MANY WHO WERE
SOUND AT THE CORE AND WHO WERE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEMSELVES
UNCONTAMINATED AMID THE SORDID SURROUNDINGS OF THEIR EVERYDAY EXISTENCE.
IF THESE MEN, WHO IN MANY CASES MEANT WELL AND WERE UPRIGHT IN
THEMSELVES, GAVE THE SUPPORT TO THE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES CARRIED ON BY
THE COMMON ENEMIES OF OUR PEOPLE, THAT WAS BECAUSE THOSE DECENT
WORKPEOPLE DID NOT AND COULD NOT GRASP THE DOWNRIGHT INFAMY OF THE
DOCTRINE TAUGHT BY THE SOCIALIST AGITATORS. FURTHERMORE, IT WAS BECAUSE
NO OTHER SECTION OF THE COMMUNITY BOTHERED ITSELF ABOUT THE LOT OF THE
WORKING CLASSES. FINALLY, THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS BECAME SUCH THAT MEN WHO
OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE ACTED DIFFERENTLY WERE FORCED TO SUBMIT TO THEM,
EVEN THOUGH UNWILLINGLY AT FIRST. A DAY CAME WHEN POVERTY GAINED THE
UPPER HAND AND DROVE THOSE WORKMEN INTO THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC RANKS.

ON INNUMERABLE OCCASIONS THE BOURGEOISIE TOOK A DEFINITE STAND AGAINST
EVEN THE MOST LEGITIMATE HUMAN DEMANDS OF THE WORKING CLASSES. THAT
CONDUCT WAS ILL-JUDGED AND INDEED IMMORAL AND COULD BRING NO GAIN
WHATSOEVER TO THE BOURGEOIS CLASS. THE RESULT WAS THAT THE HONEST
WORKMAN ABANDONED THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT OF THE TRADES UNION ORGANIZATION
AND WAS DRAGGED INTO POLITICS.

THERE WERE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF WORKMEN WHO BEGAN BY BEING HOSTILE
TO THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY; BUT THEIR DEFENCES WERE REPEATEDLY
STORMED AND FINALLY THEY HAD TO SURRENDER. YET THIS DEFEAT WAS DUE TO
THE STUPIDITY OF THE BOURGEOIS PARTIES, WHO HAD OPPOSED EVERY SOCIAL
DEMAND PUT FORWARD BY THE WORKING CLASS. THE SHORT-SIGHTED REFUSAL TO
MAKE AN EFFORT TOWARDS IMPROVING LABOUR CONDITIONS, THE REFUSAL TO ADOPT
MEASURES WHICH WOULD INSURE THE WORKMAN IN CASE OF ACCIDENTS IN THE
FACTORIES, THE REFUSAL TO FORBID CHILD LABOUR, THE REFUSAL TO CONSIDER
PROTECTIVE MEASURES FOR FEMALE WORKERS, ESPECIALLY EXPECTANT
MOTHERS--ALL THIS WAS OF ASSISTANCE TO THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADERS,
WHO WERE THANKFUL FOR EVERY OPPORTUNITY WHICH THEY COULD EXPLOIT FOR
FORCING THE MASSES INTO THEIR NET. OUR BOURGEOIS PARTIES CAN NEVER
REPAIR THE DAMAGE THAT RESULTED FROM THE MISTAKE THEY THEN MADE. FOR
THEY SOWED THE SEEDS OF HATRED WHEN THEY OPPOSED ALL EFFORTS AT SOCIAL
REFORM. AND THUS THEY GAVE, AT LEAST, APPARENT GROUNDS TO JUSTIFY THE
CLAIM PUT FORWARD BY THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS--NAMELY, THAT THEY ALONE STAND
UP FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE WORKING CLASS.

AND THIS BECAME THE PRINCIPAL GROUND FOR THE MORAL JUSTIFICATION OF THE
ACTUAL EXISTENCE OF THE TRADES UNIONS, SO THAT THE LABOUR ORGANIZATION
BECAME FROM THAT TIME ONWARDS THE CHIEF POLITICAL RECRUITING GROUND TO
SWELL THE RANKS OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

WHILE THUS STUDYING THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS AROUND ME I WAS FORCED,
WHETHER I LIKED IT OR NOT, TO DECIDE ON THE ATTITUDE I SHOULD TAKE
TOWARDS THE TRADES UNIONS. BECAUSE I LOOKED UPON THEM AS INSEPARABLE
FROM THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, MY DECISION WAS HASTY--AND MISTAKEN. I
REPUDIATED THEM AS A MATTER OF COURSE. BUT ON THIS ESSENTIAL QUESTION
ALSO FATE INTERVENED AND GAVE ME A LESSON, WITH THE RESULT THAT I
CHANGED THE OPINION WHICH I HAD FIRST FORMED.

WHEN I WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD I HAD LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE
TRADES UNION AS A MEANS OF DEFENDING THE SOCIAL RIGHTS OF THE EMPLOYEES
AND FIGHTING FOR BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS FOR THEM AND, ON THE OTHER
HAND, THE TRADES UNION AS A POLITICAL INSTRUMENT USED BY THE PARTY IN
THE CLASS STRUGGLE.

THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS UNDERSTOOD THE ENORMOUS IMPORTANCE OF THE TRADES
UNION MOVEMENT. THEY APPROPRIATED IT AS AN INSTRUMENT AND USED IT WITH
SUCCESS, WHILE THE BOURGEOIS PARTIES FAILED TO UNDERSTAND IT AND THUS
LOST THEIR POLITICAL PRESTIGE. THEY THOUGHT THAT THEIR OWN ARROGANT VETO
WOULD ARREST THE LOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE MOVEMENT AND FORCE IT INTO
AN ILLOGICAL POSITION. BUT IT IS ABSURD AND ALSO UNTRUE TO SAY THAT THE
TRADES UNION MOVEMENT IS IN ITSELF HOSTILE TO THE NATION. THE OPPOSITE
IS THE MORE CORRECT VIEW. IF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE TRADES UNION ARE
DIRECTED TOWARDS IMPROVING THE CONDITION OF A CLASS, AND SUCCEED IN
DOING SO, SUCH ACTIVITIES ARE NOT AGAINST THE FATHERLAND OR THE STATE
BUT ARE, IN THE TRUEST SENSE OF THE WORD, NATIONAL. IN THAT WAY THE
TRADES UNION ORGANIZATION HELPS TO CREATE THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS WHICH
ARE INDISPENSABLE IN A GENERAL SYSTEM OF NATIONAL EDUCATION. IT DESERVES
HIGH RECOGNITION WHEN IT DESTROYS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL GERMS
OF SOCIAL DISEASE AND THUS FOSTERS THE GENERAL WELFARE OF THE NATION.

IT IS SUPERFLUOUS TO ASK WHETHER THE TRADES UNION IS INDISPENSABLE.

SO LONG AS THERE ARE EMPLOYERS WHO ATTACK SOCIAL UNDERSTANDING AND HAVE
WRONG IDEAS OF JUSTICE AND FAIR PLAY IT IS NOT ONLY THE RIGHT BUT ALSO
THE DUTY OF THEIR EMPLOYEES--WHO ARE, AFTER ALL, AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR
PEOPLE--TO PROTECT THE GENERAL INTERESTS AGAINST THE GREED AND UNREASON
OF THE INDIVIDUAL. FOR TO SAFEGUARD THE LOYALTY AND CONFIDENCE OF THE
PEOPLE IS AS MUCH IN THE INTERESTS OF THE NATION AS TO SAFEGUARD PUBLIC
HEALTH.

BOTH ARE SERIOUSLY MENACED BY DISHONOURABLE EMPLOYERS WHO ARE NOT
CONSCIOUS OF THEIR DUTY AS MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COMMUNITY. THEIR
PERSONAL AVIDITY OR IRRESPONSIBILITY SOWS THE SEEDS OF FUTURE TROUBLE.
TO ELIMINATE THE CAUSES OF SUCH A DEVELOPMENT IS AN ACTION THAT SURELY
DESERVES WELL OF THE COUNTRY.

IT MUST NOT BE ANSWERED HERE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WORKMAN IS FREE AT ANY
TIME TO ESCAPE FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN INJUSTICE WHICH HE HAS
ACTUALLY SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF AN EMPLOYER, OR WHICH HE THINKS HE HAS
SUFFERED--IN OTHER WORDS, HE CAN LEAVE. NO. THAT ARGUMENT IS ONLY A RUSE
TO DETRACT ATTENTION FROM THE QUESTION AT ISSUE. IS IT, OR IS IT NOT, IN
THE INTERESTS OF THE NATION TO REMOVE THE CAUSES OF SOCIAL UNREST? IF IT
IS, THEN THE FIGHT MUST BE CARRIED ON WITH THE ONLY WEAPONS THAT PROMISE
SUCCESS. BUT THE INDIVIDUAL WORKMAN IS NEVER IN A POSITION TO STAND UP
AGAINST THE MIGHT OF THE BIG EMPLOYER; FOR THE QUESTION HERE IS NOT ONE
THAT CONCERNS THE TRIUMPH OF RIGHT. IF IN SUCH A RELATION RIGHT HAD BEEN
RECOGNIZED AS THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE, THEN THE CONFLICT COULD NOT HAVE
ARISEN AT ALL. BUT HERE IT IS A QUESTION OF WHO IS THE STRONGER. IF THE
CASE WERE OTHERWISE, THE SENTIMENT OF JUSTICE ALONE WOULD SOLVE THE
DISPUTE IN AN HONOURABLE WAY; OR, TO PUT THE CASE MORE CORRECTLY,
MATTERS WOULD NOT HAVE COME TO SUCH A DISPUTE AT ALL.

NO. IF UNSOCIAL AND DISHONOURABLE TREATMENT OF MEN PROVOKES RESISTANCE,
THEN THE STRONGER PARTY CAN IMPOSE ITS DECISION IN THE CONFLICT UNTIL
THE CONSTITUTIONAL LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITIES DO AWAY WITH THE EVIL THROUGH
LEGISLATION. THEREFORE IT IS EVIDENT THAT IF THE INDIVIDUAL WORKMAN IS
TO HAVE ANY CHANCE AT ALL OF WINNING THROUGH IN THE STRUGGLE HE MUST BE
GROUPED WITH HIS FELLOW WORKMEN AND PRESENT A UNITED FRONT BEFORE THE
INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYER, WHO INCORPORATES IN HIS OWN PERSON THE MASSED
STRENGTH OF THE VESTED INTERESTS IN THE INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL
UNDERTAKING WHICH HE CONDUCTS.

THUS THE TRADES UNIONS CAN HOPE TO INCULCATE AND STRENGTHEN A SENSE OF
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN WORKADAY LIFE AND OPEN THE ROAD TO PRACTICAL
RESULTS. IN DOING THIS THEY TEND TO REMOVE THOSE CAUSES OF FRICTION
WHICH ARE A CONTINUAL SOURCE OF DISCONTENT AND COMPLAINT.

BLAME FOR THE FACT THAT THE TRADES UNIONS DO NOT FULFIL THIS
MUCH-DESIRED FUNCTION MUST BE LAID AT THE DOORS OF THOSE WHO BARRED THE
ROAD TO LEGISLATIVE SOCIAL REFORM, OR RENDERED SUCH A REFORM INEFFECTIVE
BY SABOTAGING IT THROUGH THEIR POLITICAL INFLUENCE.

THE POLITICAL BOURGEOISIE FAILED TO UNDERSTAND--OR, RATHER, THEY DID NOT
WISH TO UNDERSTAND--THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TRADES UNION MOVEMENT. THE
SOCIAL DEMOCRATS ACCORDINGLY SEIZED THE ADVANTAGE OFFERED THEM BY THIS
MISTAKEN POLICY AND TOOK THE LABOUR MOVEMENT UNDER THEIR EXCLUSIVE
PROTECTION, WITHOUT ANY PROTEST FROM THE OTHER SIDE. IN THIS WAY THEY
ESTABLISHED FOR THEMSELVES A SOLID BULWARK BEHIND WHICH THEY COULD
SAFELY RETIRE WHENEVER THE STRUGGLE ASSUMED A CRITICAL ASPECT. THUS THE
GENUINE PURPOSE OF THE MOVEMENT GRADUALLY FELL INTO OBLIVION, AND WAS
REPLACED BY NEW OBJECTIVES. FOR THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS NEVER TROUBLED
THEMSELVES TO RESPECT AND UPHOLD THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE
TRADE UNIONIST MOVEMENT WAS FOUNDED. THEY SIMPLY TOOK OVER THE MOVEMENT,
LOCK, STOCK AND BARREL, TO SERVE THEIR OWN POLITICAL ENDS.

WITHIN A FEW DECADES THE TRADES UNION MOVEMENT WAS TRANSFORMED, BY THE
EXPERT HAND OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY, FROM AN INSTRUMENT WHICH HAD BEEN
ORIGINALLY FASHIONED FOR THE DEFENCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS INTO AN INSTRUMENT
FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC STRUCTURE. THE INTERESTS OF
THE WORKING CLASS WERE NOT ALLOWED FOR A MOMENT TO CROSS THE PATH OF
THIS PURPOSE; FOR IN POLITICS THE APPLICATION OF ECONOMIC PRESSURE IS
ALWAYS POSSIBLE IF THE ONE SIDE BE SUFFICIENTLY UNSCRUPULOUS AND THE
OTHER SUFFICIENTLY INERT AND DOCILE. IN THIS CASE BOTH CONDITIONS WERE
FULFILLED.

BY THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENT CENTURY THE TRADES UNIONIST MOVEMENT HAD
ALREADY CEASED TO RECOGNIZE THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT HAD BEEN FOUNDED.
FROM YEAR TO YEAR IT FELL MORE AND MORE UNDER THE POLITICAL CONTROL OF
THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS, UNTIL IT FINALLY CAME TO BE USED AS A
BATTERING-RAM IN THE CLASS STRUGGLE. THE PLAN WAS TO SHATTER, BY MEANS
OF CONSTANTLY REPEATED BLOWS, THE ECONOMIC EDIFICE IN THE BUILDING OF
WHICH SO MUCH TIME AND CARE HAD BEEN EXPENDED. ONCE THIS OBJECTIVE HAD
BEEN REACHED, THE DESTRUCTION OF THE STATE WOULD BECOME A MATTER OF
COURSE, BECAUSE THE STATE WOULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF ITS
ECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS. ATTENTION TO THE REAL INTERESTS OF THE
WORKING-CLASSES, ON THE PART OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS, STEADILY DECREASED
UNTIL THE CUNNING LEADERS SAW THAT IT WOULD BE IN THEIR IMMEDIATE
POLITICAL INTERESTS IF THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL DEMANDS OF THE BROAD
MASSES REMAINED UNHEEDED; FOR THERE WAS A DANGER THAT IF THESE MASSES
ONCE FELT CONTENT THEY COULD NO LONGER BE EMPLOYED AS MERE PASSIVE
MATERIAL IN THE POLITICAL STRUGGLE.

THE GLOOMY PROSPECT WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF TO THE EYES OF THE
CONDOTTIERI OF THE CLASS WARFARE, IF THE DISCONTENT OF THE MASSES WERE
NO LONGER AVAILABLE AS A WAR WEAPON, CREATED SO MUCH ANXIETY AMONG THEM
THAT THEY SUPPRESSED AND OPPOSED EVEN THE MOST ELEMENTARY MEASURES OF
SOCIAL REFORM. AND CONDITIONS WERE SUCH THAT THOSE LEADERS DID NOT HAVE
TO TROUBLE ABOUT ATTEMPTING TO JUSTIFY SUCH AN ILLOGICAL POLICY.

AS THE MASSES WERE TAUGHT TO INCREASE AND HEIGHTEN THEIR DEMANDS THE
POSSIBILITY OF SATISFYING THEM DWINDLED AND WHATEVER AMELIORATIVE
MEASURES WERE TAKEN BECAME LESS AND LESS SIGNIFICANT; SO THAT IT WAS AT
THAT TIME POSSIBLE TO PERSUADE THE MASSES THAT THIS RIDICULOUS MEASURE
IN WHICH THE MOST SACRED CLAIMS OF THE WORKING-CLASSES WERE BEING
GRANTED REPRESENTED A DIABOLICAL PLAN TO WEAKEN THEIR FIGHTING POWER IN
THIS EASY WAY AND, IF POSSIBLE, TO PARALYSE IT. ONE WILL NOT BE
ASTONISHED AT THE SUCCESS OF THESE ALLEGATIONS IF ONE REMEMBERS WHAT A
SMALL MEASURE OF THINKING POWER THE BROAD MASSES POSSESS.

IN THE BOURGEOIS CAMP THERE WAS HIGH INDIGNATION OVER THE BAD FAITH OF
THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC TACTICS; BUT NOTHING WAS DONE TO DRAW A PRACTICAL
CONCLUSION AND ORGANIZE A COUNTER ATTACK FROM THE BOURGEOIS SIDE. THE
FEAR OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS, TO IMPROVE THE MISERABLE CONDITIONS OF THE
WORKING-CLASSES OUGHT TO HAVE INDUCED THE BOURGEOIS PARTIES TO MAKE THE
MOST ENERGETIC EFFORTS IN THIS DIRECTION AND THUS SNATCH FROM THE HANDS
OF THE CLASS-WARFARE LEADERS THEIR MOST IMPORTANT WEAPON; BUT NOTHING OF
THIS KIND HAPPENED.

INSTEAD OF ATTACKING THE POSITION OF THEIR ADVERSARIES THE BOURGEOISIE
ALLOWED ITSELF TO BE PRESSED AND HARRIED. FINALLY IT ADOPTED MEANS THAT
WERE SO TARDY AND SO INSIGNIFICANT THAT THEY WERE INEFFECTIVE AND WERE
REPUDIATED. SO THE WHOLE SITUATION REMAINED JUST AS IT HAD BEEN BEFORE
THE BOURGEOIS INTERVENTION; BUT THE DISCONTENT HAD THEREBY BECOME MORE
SERIOUS.

LIKE A THREATENING STORM, THE 'FREE TRADES UNION' HOVERED ABOVE THE
POLITICAL HORIZON AND ABOVE THE LIFE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL. IT WAS ONE OF
THE MOST FRIGHTFUL INSTRUMENTS OF TERROR THAT THREATENED THE SECURITY
AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC STRUCTURE, THE FOUNDATIONS OF
THE STATE AND THE LIBERTY OF THE INDIVIDUAL. ABOVE ALL, IT WAS THE 'FREE
TRADES UNION' THAT TURNED DEMOCRACY INTO A RIDICULOUS AND SCORNED
PHRASE, INSULTED THE IDEAL OF LIBERTY AND STIGMATIZED THAT OF FRATERNITY
WITH THE SLOGAN 'IF YOU WILL NOT BECOME OUR COMRADE WE SHALL CRACK YOUR
SKULL'.

IT WAS THUS THAT I THEN CAME TO KNOW THIS FRIEND OF HUMANITY. DURING THE
YEARS THAT FOLLOWED MY KNOWLEDGE OF IT BECAME WIDER AND DEEPER; BUT I
HAVE NEVER CHANGED ANYTHING IN THAT REGARD.

THE MORE I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH THE EXTERNAL FORMS OF SOCIAL
DEMOCRACY, THE GREATER BECAME MY DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND THE INNER NATURE
OF ITS DOCTRINES.

FOR THIS PURPOSE THE OFFICIAL LITERATURE OF THE PARTY COULD NOT HELP
VERY MUCH. IN DISCUSSING ECONOMIC QUESTIONS ITS STATEMENTS WERE FALSE
AND ITS PROOFS UNSOUND. IN TREATING OF POLITICAL AIMS ITS ATTITUDE WAS
INSINCERE. FURTHERMORE, ITS MODERN METHODS OF CHICANERY IN THE
PRESENTATION OF ITS ARGUMENTS WERE PROFOUNDLY REPUGNANT TO ME. ITS
FLAMBOYANT SENTENCES, ITS OBSCURE AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE PHRASES,
PRETENDED TO CONTAIN GREAT THOUGHTS, BUT THEY WERE DEVOID OF THOUGHT,
AND MEANINGLESS. ONE WOULD HAVE TO BE A DECADENT BOHEMIAN IN ONE OF OUR
MODERN CITIES IN ORDER TO FEEL AT HOME IN THAT LABYRINTH OF MENTAL
ABERRATION, SO THAT HE MIGHT DISCOVER 'INTIMATE EXPERIENCES' AMID THE
STINKING FUMES OF THIS LITERARY DADISM. THESE WRITERS WERE OBVIOUSLY
COUNTING ON THE PROVERBIAL HUMILITY OF A CERTAIN SECTION OF OUR PEOPLE,
WHO BELIEVE THAT A PERSON WHO IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE MUST BE PROFOUNDLY
WISE.

IN CONFRONTING THE THEORETICAL FALSITY AND ABSURDITY OF THAT DOCTRINE
WITH THE REALITY OF ITS EXTERNAL MANIFESTATIONS, I GRADUALLY CAME TO
HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF THE ENDS AT WHICH IT AIMED.

DURING SUCH MOMENTS I HAD DARK PRESENTIMENTS AND FEARED SOMETHING EVIL.
I HAD BEFORE ME A TEACHING INSPIRED BY EGOISM AND HATRED, MATHEMATICALLY
CALCULATED TO WIN ITS VICTORY, BUT THE TRIUMPH OF WHICH WOULD BE A
MORTAL BLOW TO HUMANITY.

MEANWHILE I HAD DISCOVERED THE RELATIONS EXISTING BETWEEN THIS
DESTRUCTIVE TEACHING AND THE SPECIFIC CHARACTER OF A PEOPLE, WHO UP TO
THAT TIME HAD BEEN TO ME ALMOST UNKNOWN.

KNOWLEDGE OF THE JEWS IS THE ONLY KEY WHEREBY ONE MAY UNDERSTAND THE
INNER NATURE AND THEREFORE THE REAL AIMS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY.

THE MAN WHO HAS COME TO KNOW THIS RACE HAS SUCCEEDED IN REMOVING FROM
HIS EYES THE VEIL THROUGH WHICH HE HAD SEEN THE AIMS AND MEANING OF HIS
PARTY IN A FALSE LIGHT; AND THEN, OUT OF THE MURK AND FOG OF SOCIAL
PHRASES RISES THE GRIMACING FIGURE OF MARXISM.

TO-DAY IT IS HARD AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY WHEN THE WORD
'JEW' FIRST BEGAN TO RAISE ANY PARTICULAR THOUGHT IN MY MIND. I DO NOT
REMEMBER EVEN HAVING HEARD THE WORD AT HOME DURING MY FATHER'S LIFETIME.
IF THIS NAME WERE MENTIONED IN A DEROGATORY SENSE I THINK THE OLD
GENTLEMAN WOULD JUST HAVE CONSIDERED THOSE WHO USED IT IN THIS WAY AS
BEING UNEDUCATED REACTIONARIES. IN THE COURSE OF HIS CAREER HE HAD COME
TO BE MORE OR LESS A COSMOPOLITAN, WITH STRONG VIEWS ON NATIONALISM,
WHICH HAD ITS EFFECT ON ME AS WELL. IN SCHOOL, TOO, I FOUND NO REASON TO
ALTER THE PICTURE OF THINGS I HAD FORMED AT HOME.

AT THE REALSCHULE I KNEW ONE JEWISH BOY. WE WERE ALL ON OUR GUARD IN OUR
RELATIONS WITH HIM, BUT ONLY BECAUSE HIS RETICENCE AND CERTAIN ACTIONS
OF HIS WARNED US TO BE DISCREET. BEYOND THAT MY COMPANIONS AND MYSELF
FORMED NO PARTICULAR OPINIONS IN REGARD TO HIM.

IT WAS NOT UNTIL I WAS FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS OLD THAT I FREQUENTLY
RAN UP AGAINST THE WORD 'JEW', PARTLY IN CONNECTION WITH POLITICAL
CONTROVERSIES. THESE REFERENCES AROUSED A SLIGHT AVERSION IN ME, AND I
COULD NOT AVOID AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING WHICH ALWAYS CAME OVER ME WHEN
I HAD TO LISTEN TO RELIGIOUS DISPUTES. BUT AT THAT TIME I HAD NO OTHER
FEELINGS ABOUT THE JEWISH QUESTION.

THERE WERE VERY FEW JEWS IN LINZ. IN THE COURSE OF CENTURIES THE JEWS
WHO LIVED THERE HAD BECOME EUROPEANIZED IN EXTERNAL APPEARANCE AND WERE
SO MUCH LIKE OTHER HUMAN BEINGS THAT I EVEN LOOKED UPON THEM AS GERMANS.
THE REASON WHY I DID NOT THEN PERCEIVE THE ABSURDITY OF SUCH AN ILLUSION
WAS THAT THE ONLY EXTERNAL MARK WHICH I RECOGNIZED AS DISTINGUISHING
THEM FROM US WAS THE PRACTICE OF THEIR STRANGE RELIGION. AS I THOUGHT
THAT THEY WERE PERSECUTED ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR FAITH MY AVERSION TO
HEARING REMARKS AGAINST THEM GREW ALMOST INTO A FEELING OF ABHORRENCE. I
DID NOT IN THE LEAST SUSPECT THAT THERE COULD BE SUCH A THING AS A
SYSTEMATIC ANTI-SEMITISM.

THEN I CAME TO VIENNA.

CONFUSED BY THE MASS OF IMPRESSIONS I RECEIVED FROM THE ARCHITECTURAL
SURROUNDINGS AND DEPRESSED BY MY OWN TROUBLES, I DID NOT AT FIRST
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SOCIAL STRATA OF WHICH THE POPULATION
OF THAT MAMMOTH CITY WAS COMPOSED. ALTHOUGH VIENNA THEN HAD ABOUT TWO
HUNDRED THOUSAND JEWS AMONG ITS POPULATION OF TWO MILLIONS, I DID NOT
NOTICE THEM. DURING THE FIRST WEEKS OF MY SOJOURN MY EYES AND MY MIND
WERE UNABLE TO COPE WITH THE ONRUSH OF NEW IDEAS AND VALUES. NOT UNTIL I
GRADUALLY SETTLED DOWN TO MY SURROUNDINGS, AND THE CONFUSED PICTURE
BEGAN TO GROW CLEARER, DID I ACQUIRE A MORE DISCRIMINATING VIEW OF MY
NEW WORLD. AND WITH THAT I CAME UP AGAINST THE JEWISH PROBLEM.

I WILL NOT SAY THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH I FIRST BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH
IT WAS PARTICULARLY UNPLEASANT FOR ME. IN THE JEW I STILL SAW ONLY A MAN
WHO WAS OF A DIFFERENT RELIGION, AND THEREFORE, ON GROUNDS OF HUMAN
TOLERANCE, I WAS AGAINST THE IDEA THAT HE SHOULD BE ATTACKED BECAUSE HE
HAD A DIFFERENT FAITH. AND SO I CONSIDERED THAT THE TONE ADOPTED BY THE
ANTI-SEMITIC PRESS IN VIENNA WAS UNWORTHY OF THE CULTURAL TRADITIONS OF
A GREAT PEOPLE. THE MEMORY OF CERTAIN EVENTS WHICH HAPPENED IN THE
MIDDLE AGES CAME INTO MY MIND, AND I FELT THAT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE
THEM REPEATED. GENERALLY SPEAKING, THESE ANTI-SEMITIC NEWSPAPERS DID NOT
BELONG TO THE FIRST RANK--BUT I DID NOT THEN UNDERSTAND THE REASON OF
THIS--AND SO I REGARDED THEM MORE AS THE PRODUCTS OF JEALOUSY AND ENVY
RATHER THAN THE EXPRESSION OF A SINCERE, THOUGH WRONG-HEADED, FEELING.

MY OWN OPINIONS WERE CONFIRMED BY WHAT I CONSIDERED TO BE THE INFINITELY
MORE DIGNIFIED MANNER IN WHICH THE REALLY GREAT PRESS REPLIED TO THOSE
ATTACKS OR SIMPLY IGNORED THEM, WHICH LATTER SEEMED TO ME THE MOST
RESPECTABLE WAY.

I DILIGENTLY READ WHAT WAS GENERALLY CALLED THE WORLD PRESS--NEUE FREIE
PRESSE, WIENER TAGEBLATT, ETC.--AND I WAS ASTONISHED BY THE ABUNDANCE OF
INFORMATION THEY GAVE THEIR READERS AND THE IMPARTIAL WAY IN WHICH THEY
PRESENTED PARTICULAR PROBLEMS. I APPRECIATED THEIR DIGNIFIED TONE; BUT
SOMETIMES THE FLAMBOYANCY OF THE STYLE WAS UNCONVINCING, AND I DID NOT
LIKE IT. BUT I ATTRIBUTED ALL THIS TO THE OVERPOWERING INFLUENCE OF THE
WORLD METROPOLIS.

SINCE I CONSIDERED VIENNA AT THAT TIME AS SUCH A WORLD METROPOLIS, I
THOUGHT THIS CONSTITUTED SUFFICIENT GROUNDS TO EXCUSE THESE SHORTCOMINGS
OF THE PRESS. BUT I WAS FREQUENTLY DISGUSTED BY THE GROVELLING WAY IN
WHICH THE VIENNA PRESS PLAYED LACKEY TO THE COURT. SCARCELY A MOVE TOOK
PLACE AT THE HOFBURG WHICH WAS NOT PRESENTED IN GLORIFIED COLOURS TO THE
READERS. IT WAS A FOOLISH PRACTICE, WHICH, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT HAD TO DO
WITH 'THE WISEST MONARCH OF ALL TIMES', REMINDED ONE ALMOST OF THE DANCE
WHICH THE MOUNTAIN COCK PERFORMS AT PAIRING TIME TO WOO HIS MATE. IT WAS
ALL EMPTY NONSENSE. AND I THOUGHT THAT SUCH A POLICY WAS A STAIN ON THE
IDEAL OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAY OF CURRYING FAVOUR
AT THE COURT WAS UNWORTHY OF THE PEOPLE. AND THAT WAS THE FIRST BLOT
THAT FELL ON MY APPRECIATION OF THE GREAT VIENNA PRESS.

WHILE IN VIENNA I CONTINUED TO FOLLOW WITH A VIVID INTEREST ALL THE
EVENTS THAT WERE TAKING PLACE IN GERMANY, WHETHER CONNECTED WITH
POLITICAL OR CULTURAL QUESTION. I HAD A FEELING OF PRIDE AND ADMIRATION
WHEN I COMPARED THE RISE OF THE YOUNG GERMAN EMPIRE WITH THE DECLINE OF
THE AUSTRIAN STATE. BUT, ALTHOUGH THE FOREIGN POLICY OF THAT EMPIRE WAS
A SOURCE OF REAL PLEASURE ON THE WHOLE, THE INTERNAL POLITICAL
HAPPENINGS WERE NOT ALWAYS SO SATISFACTORY. I DID NOT APPROVE OF THE
CAMPAIGN WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS BEING CARRIED ON AGAINST WILLIAM II. I
LOOKED UPON HIM NOT ONLY AS THE GERMAN EMPEROR BUT, ABOVE ALL, AS THE
CREATOR OF THE GERMAN NAVY. THE FACT THAT THE EMPEROR WAS PROHIBITED
FROM SPEAKING IN THE REICHSTAG MADE ME VERY ANGRY, BECAUSE THE
PROHIBITION CAME FROM A SIDE WHICH IN MY EYES HAD NO AUTHORITY TO MAKE
IT. FOR AT A SINGLE SITTING THOSE SAME PARLIAMENTARY GANDERS DID MORE
CACKLING TOGETHER THAN THE WHOLE DYNASTY OF EMPERORS, COMPRISING EVEN
THE WEAKEST, HAD DONE IN THE COURSE OF CENTURIES.

IT ANNOYED ME TO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN A NATION WHERE ANY
HALF-WITTED FELLOW COULD CLAIM FOR HIMSELF THE RIGHT TO CRITICIZE AND
MIGHT EVEN BE LET LOOSE ON THE PEOPLE AS A 'LEGISLATOR' IN THE
REICHSTAG, THE BEARER OF THE IMPERIAL CROWN COULD BE THE SUBJECT OF A
'REPRIMAND' ON THE PART OF THE MOST MISERABLE ASSEMBLY OF DRIVELLERS
THAT HAD EVER EXISTED.

I WAS EVEN MORE DISGUSTED AT THE WAY IN WHICH THIS SAME VIENNA PRESS
SALAAMED OBSEQUIOUSLY BEFORE THE MEANEST STEED BELONGING TO THE HABSBURG
ROYAL EQUIPAGE AND WENT OFF INTO WILD ECSTACIES OF DELIGHT IF THE NAG
WAGGED ITS TAIL IN RESPONSE. AND AT THE SAME TIME THESE NEWSPAPERS TOOK
UP AN ATTITUDE OF ANXIETY IN MATTERS THAT CONCERNED THE GERMAN EMPEROR,
TRYING TO CLOAK THEIR ENMITY BY THE SERIOUS AIR THEY GAVE THEMSELVES.
BUT IN MY EYES THAT ENMITY APPEARED TO BE ONLY POORLY CLOAKED. NATURALLY
THEY PROTESTED THAT THEY HAD NO INTENTION OF MIXING IN GERMANY'S
INTERNAL AFFAIRS--GOD FORBID! THEY PRETENDED THAT BY TOUCHING A DELICATE
SPOT IN SUCH A FRIENDLY WAY THEY WERE FULFILLING A DUTY THAT DEVOLVED
UPON THEM BY REASON OF THE MUTUAL ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AND
AT THE SAME TIME DISCHARGING THEIR OBLIGATIONS OF JOURNALISTIC
TRUTHFULNESS. HAVING THUS EXCUSED THEMSELVES ABOUT TENDERLY TOUCHING A
SORE SPOT, THEY BORED WITH THE FINGER RUTHLESSLY INTO THE WOUND.

THAT SORT OF THING MADE MY BLOOD BOIL. AND NOW I BEGAN TO BE MORE AND
MORE ON MY GUARD WHEN READING THE GREAT VIENNA PRESS.

I HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE, HOWEVER, THAT ON SUCH SUBJECTS ONE OF THE
ANTI-SEMITIC PAPERS--THE DEUTSCHE VOLKSBLATT--ACTED MORE DECENTLY.

WHAT GOT STILL MORE ON MY NERVES WAS THE REPUGNANT MANNER IN WHICH THE
BIG NEWSPAPERS CULTIVATED ADMIRATION FOR FRANCE. ONE REALLY HAD TO FEEL
ASHAMED OF BEING A GERMAN WHEN CONFRONTED BY THOSE MELLIFLUOUS HYMNS OF
PRAISE FOR 'THE GREAT CULTURE-NATION'. THIS WRETCHED GALLOMANIA MORE
OFTEN THAN ONCE MADE ME THROW AWAY ONE OF THOSE 'WORLD NEWSPAPERS'. I
NOW OFTEN TURNED TO THE VOLKSBLATT, WHICH WAS MUCH SMALLER IN SIZE BUT
WHICH TREATED SUCH SUBJECTS MORE DECENTLY. I WAS NOT IN ACCORD WITH ITS
SHARP ANTI-SEMITIC TONE; BUT AGAIN AND AGAIN I FOUND THAT ITS ARGUMENTS
GAVE ME GROUNDS FOR SERIOUS THOUGHT.

ANYHOW, IT WAS AS A RESULT OF SUCH READING THAT I CAME TO KNOW THE MAN
AND THE MOVEMENT WHICH THEN DETERMINED THE FATE OF VIENNA. THESE WERE
DR. KARL LUEGER AND THE CHRISTIAN SOCIALIST MOVEMENT. AT THE TIME I CAME
TO VIENNA I FELT OPPOSED TO BOTH. I LOOKED ON THE MAN AND THE MOVEMENT
AS 'REACTIONARY'.

BUT EVEN AN ELEMENTARY SENSE OF JUSTICE ENFORCED ME TO CHANGE MY OPINION
WHEN I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF KNOWING THE MAN AND HIS WORK, AND SLOWLY
THAT OPINION GREW INTO OUTSPOKEN ADMIRATION WHEN I HAD BETTER GROUNDS
FOR FORMING A JUDGMENT. TO-DAY, AS WELL AS THEN, I HOLD DR. KARL LUEGER
AS THE MOST EMINENT TYPE OF GERMAN BURGERMEISTER. HOW MANY PREJUDICES
WERE THROWN OVER THROUGH SUCH A CHANGE IN MY ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE
CHRISTIAN-SOCIALIST MOVEMENT!

MY IDEAS ABOUT ANTI-SEMITISM CHANGED ALSO IN THE COURSE OF TIME, BUT
THAT WAS THE CHANGE WHICH I FOUND MOST DIFFICULT. IT COST ME A GREATER
INTERNAL CONFLICT WITH MYSELF, AND IT WAS ONLY AFTER A STRUGGLE BETWEEN
REASON AND SENTIMENT THAT VICTORY BEGAN TO BE DECIDED IN FAVOUR OF THE
FORMER. TWO YEARS LATER SENTIMENT RALLIED TO THE SIDE OF REASONS AND
BECAME A FAITHFUL GUARDIAN AND COUNSELLOR.

AT THE TIME OF THIS BITTER STRUGGLE, BETWEEN CALM REASON AND THE
SENTIMENTS IN WHICH I HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP, THE LESSONS THAT I LEARNED ON
THE STREETS OF VIENNA RENDERED ME INVALUABLE ASSISTANCE. A TIME CAME
WHEN I NO LONGER PASSED BLINDLY ALONG THE STREET OF THE MIGHTY CITY, AS
I HAD DONE IN THE EARLY DAYS, BUT NOW WITH MY EYES OPEN NOT ONLY TO
STUDY THE BUILDINGS BUT ALSO THE HUMAN BEINGS.

ONCE, WHEN PASSING THROUGH THE INNER CITY, I SUDDENLY ENCOUNTERED A
PHENOMENON IN A LONG CAFTAN AND WEARING BLACK SIDE-LOCKS. MY FIRST
THOUGHT WAS: IS THIS A JEW? THEY CERTAINLY DID NOT HAVE THIS APPEARANCE
IN LINZ. I WATCHED THE MAN STEALTHILY AND CAUTIOUSLY; BUT THE LONGER I
GAZED AT THE STRANGE COUNTENANCE AND EXAMINED IT FEATURE BY FEATURE, THE
MORE THE QUESTION SHAPED ITSELF IN MY BRAIN: IS THIS A GERMAN?

AS WAS ALWAYS MY HABIT WITH SUCH EXPERIENCES, I TURNED TO BOOKS FOR HELP
IN REMOVING MY DOUBTS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I BOUGHT MYSELF
SOME ANTI-SEMITIC PAMPHLETS FOR A FEW PENCE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY ALL
BEGAN WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT IN PRINCIPLE THE READER HAD AT LEAST A
CERTAIN DEGREE OF INFORMATION ON THE JEWISH QUESTION OR WAS EVEN
FAMILIAR WITH IT. MOREOVER, THE TONE OF MOST OF THESE PAMPHLETS WAS SUCH
THAT I BECAME DOUBTFUL AGAIN, BECAUSE THE STATEMENTS MADE WERE PARTLY
SUPERFICIAL AND THE PROOFS EXTRAORDINARILY UNSCIENTIFIC. FOR WEEKS, AND
INDEED FOR MONTHS, I RETURNED TO MY OLD WAY OF THINKING. THE SUBJECT
APPEARED SO ENORMOUS AND THE ACCUSATIONS WERE SO FAR-REACHING THAT I WAS
AFRAID OF DEALING WITH IT UNJUSTLY AND SO I BECAME AGAIN ANXIOUS AND
UNCERTAIN.

NATURALLY I COULD NO LONGER DOUBT THAT HERE THERE WAS NOT A QUESTION OF
GERMANS WHO HAPPENED TO BE OF A DIFFERENT RELIGION BUT RATHER THAT THERE
WAS QUESTION OF AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PEOPLE. FOR AS SOON AS I BEGAN TO
INVESTIGATE THE MATTER AND OBSERVE THE JEWS, THEN VIENNA APPEARED TO ME
IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT. WHEREVER I NOW WENT I SAW JEWS, AND THE MORE I SAW
OF THEM THE MORE STRIKINGLY AND CLEARLY THEY STOOD OUT AS A DIFFERENT
PEOPLE FROM THE OTHER CITIZENS. ESPECIALLY THE INNER CITY AND THE
DISTRICT NORTHWARDS FROM THE DANUBE CANAL SWARMED WITH A PEOPLE WHO,
EVEN IN OUTER APPEARANCE, BORE NO SIMILARITY TO THE GERMANS.

BUT ANY INDECISION WHICH I MAY STILL HAVE FELT ABOUT THAT POINT WAS
FINALLY REMOVED BY THE ACTIVITIES OF A CERTAIN SECTION OF THE JEWS
THEMSELVES. A GREAT MOVEMENT, CALLED ZIONISM, AROSE AMONG THEM. ITS AIM
WAS TO ASSERT THE NATIONAL CHARACTER OF JUDAISM, AND THE MOVEMENT WAS
STRONGLY REPRESENTED IN VIENNA.

TO OUTWARD APPEARANCES IT SEEMED AS IF ONLY ONE GROUP OF JEWS CHAMPIONED
THIS MOVEMENT, WHILE THE GREAT MAJORITY DISAPPROVED OF IT, OR EVEN
REPUDIATED IT. BUT AN INVESTIGATION OF THE SITUATION SHOWED THAT THOSE
OUTWARD APPEARANCES WERE PURPOSELY MISLEADING. THESE OUTWARD APPEARANCES
EMERGED FROM A MIST OF THEORIES WHICH HAD BEEN PRODUCED FOR REASONS OF
EXPEDIENCY, IF NOT FOR PURPOSES OF DOWNRIGHT DECEPTION. FOR THAT PART OF
JEWRY WHICH WAS STYLED LIBERAL DID NOT DISOWN THE ZIONISTS AS IF THEY
WERE NOT MEMBERS OF THEIR RACE BUT RATHER AS BROTHER JEWS WHO PUBLICLY
PROFESSED THEIR FAITH IN AN UNPRACTICAL WAY, SO AS TO CREATE A DANGER
FOR JEWRY ITSELF.

THUS THERE WAS NO REAL RIFT IN THEIR INTERNAL SOLIDARITY.

THIS FICTITIOUS CONFLICT BETWEEN THE ZIONISTS AND THE LIBERAL JEWS SOON
DISGUSTED ME; FOR IT WAS FALSE THROUGH AND THROUGH AND IN DIRECT
CONTRADICTION TO THE MORAL DIGNITY AND IMMACULATE CHARACTER ON WHICH
THAT RACE HAD ALWAYS PRIDED ITSELF.

CLEANLINESS, WHETHER MORAL OR OF ANOTHER KIND, HAD ITS OWN PECULIAR
MEANING FOR THESE PEOPLE. THAT THEY WERE WATER-SHY WAS OBVIOUS ON
LOOKING AT THEM AND, UNFORTUNATELY, VERY OFTEN ALSO WHEN NOT LOOKING AT
THEM AT ALL. THE ODOUR OF THOSE PEOPLE IN CAFTANS OFTEN USED TO MAKE ME
FEEL ILL. BEYOND THAT THERE WERE THE UNKEMPT CLOTHES AND THE IGNOBLE
EXTERIOR.

ALL THESE DETAILS WERE CERTAINLY NOT ATTRACTIVE; BUT THE REVOLTING
FEATURE WAS THAT BENEATH THEIR UNCLEAN EXTERIOR ONE SUDDENLY PERCEIVED
THE MORAL MILDEW OF THE CHOSEN RACE.

WHAT SOON GAVE ME CAUSE FOR VERY SERIOUS CONSIDERATION WERE THE
ACTIVITIES OF THE JEWS IN CERTAIN BRANCHES OF LIFE, INTO THE MYSTERY OF
WHICH I PENETRATED LITTLE BY LITTLE. WAS THERE ANY SHADY UNDERTAKING,
ANY FORM OF FOULNESS, ESPECIALLY IN CULTURAL LIFE, IN WHICH AT LEAST ONE
JEW DID NOT PARTICIPATE? ON PUTTING THE PROBING KNIFE CAREFULLY TO THAT
KIND OF ABSCESS ONE IMMEDIATELY DISCOVERED, LIKE A MAGGOT IN A
PUTRESCENT BODY, A LITTLE JEW WHO WAS OFTEN BLINDED BY THE SUDDEN LIGHT.

IN MY EYES THE CHARGE AGAINST JUDAISM BECAME A GRAVE ONE THE MOMENT I
DISCOVERED THE JEWISH ACTIVITIES IN THE PRESS, IN ART, IN LITERATURE AND
THE THEATRE. ALL UNCTUOUS PROTESTS WERE NOW MORE OR LESS FUTILE. ONE
NEEDED ONLY TO LOOK AT THE POSTERS ANNOUNCING THE HIDEOUS PRODUCTIONS OF
THE CINEMA AND THEATRE, AND STUDY THE NAMES OF THE AUTHORS WHO WERE
HIGHLY LAUDED THERE IN ORDER TO BECOME PERMANENTLY ADAMANT ON JEWISH
QUESTIONS. HERE WAS A PESTILENCE, A MORAL PESTILENCE, WITH WHICH THE
PUBLIC WAS BEING INFECTED. IT WAS WORSE THAN THE BLACK PLAGUE OF LONG
AGO. AND IN WHAT MIGHTY DOSES THIS POISON WAS MANUFACTURED AND
DISTRIBUTED. NATURALLY, THE LOWER THE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL LEVEL OF
SUCH AN AUTHOR OF ARTISTIC PRODUCTS THE MORE INEXHAUSTIBLE HIS
FECUNDITY. SOMETIMES IT WENT SO FAR THAT ONE OF THESE FELLOWS, ACTING
LIKE A SEWAGE PUMP, WOULD SHOOT HIS FILTH DIRECTLY IN THE FACE OF OTHER
MEMBERS OF THE HUMAN RACE. IN THIS CONNECTION WE MUST REMEMBER THERE IS
NO LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF SUCH PEOPLE. ONE OUGHT TO REALIZE THAT FOR
ONE, GOETHE, NATURE MAY BRING INTO EXISTENCE TEN THOUSAND SUCH
DESPOILERS WHO ACT AS THE WORST KIND OF GERM-CARRIERS IN POISONING HUMAN
SOULS. IT WAS A TERRIBLE THOUGHT, AND YET IT COULD NOT BE AVOIDED, THAT
THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE JEWS SEEMED SPECIALLY DESTINED BY NATURE TO
PLAY THIS SHAMEFUL PART.

AND IS IT FOR THIS REASON THAT THEY CAN BE CALLED THE CHOSEN PEOPLE?

I BEGAN THEN TO INVESTIGATE CAREFULLY THE NAMES OF ALL THE FABRICATORS
OF THESE UNCLEAN PRODUCTS IN PUBLIC CULTURAL LIFE. THE RESULT OF THAT
INQUIRY WAS STILL MORE DISFAVOURABLE TO THE ATTITUDE WHICH I HAD
HITHERTO HELD IN REGARD TO THE JEWS. THOUGH MY FEELINGS MIGHT REBEL A
THOUSAND TIME, REASON NOW HAD TO DRAW ITS OWN CONCLUSIONS.

THE FACT THAT NINE-TENTHS OF ALL THE SMUTTY LITERATURE, ARTISTIC TRIPE
AND THEATRICAL BANALITIES, HAD TO BE CHARGED TO THE ACCOUNT OF PEOPLE
WHO FORMED SCARCELY ONE PER CENT. OF THE NATION--THAT FACT COULD NOT BE
GAINSAID. IT WAS THERE, AND HAD TO BE ADMITTED. THEN I BEGAN TO EXAMINE
MY FAVOURITE 'WORLD PRESS', WITH THAT FACT BEFORE MY MIND.

THE DEEPER MY SOUNDINGS WENT THE LESSER GREW MY RESPECT FOR THAT PRESS
WHICH I FORMERLY ADMIRED. ITS STYLE BECAME STILL MORE REPELLENT AND I
WAS FORCED TO REJECT ITS IDEAS AS ENTIRELY SHALLOW AND SUPERFICIAL. TO
CLAIM THAT IN THE PRESENTATION OF FACTS AND VIEWS ITS ATTITUDE WAS
IMPARTIAL SEEMED TO ME TO CONTAIN MORE FALSEHOOD THAN TRUTH. THE WRITERS
WERE--JEWS.

THOUSANDS OF DETAILS THAT I HAD SCARCELY NOTICED BEFORE SEEMED TO ME NOW
TO DESERVE ATTENTION. I BEGAN TO GRASP AND UNDERSTAND THINGS WHICH I HAD
FORMERLY LOOKED AT IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT.

I SAW THE LIBERAL POLICY OF THAT PRESS IN ANOTHER LIGHT. ITS DIGNIFIED
TONE IN REPLYING TO THE ATTACKS OF ITS ADVERSARIES AND ITS DEAD SILENCE
IN OTHER CASES NOW BECAME CLEAR TO ME AS PART OF A CUNNING AND
DESPICABLE WAY OF DECEIVING THE READERS. ITS BRILLIANT THEATRICAL
CRITICISMS ALWAYS PRAISED THE JEWISH AUTHORS AND ITS ADVERSE, CRITICISM
WAS RESERVED EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE GERMANS.

THE LIGHT PIN-PRICKS AGAINST WILLIAM II SHOWED THE PERSISTENCY OF ITS
POLICY, JUST AS DID ITS SYSTEMATIC COMMENDATION OF FRENCH CULTURE AND
CIVILIZATION. THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE FEUILLETONS WAS TRIVIAL AND
OFTEN PORNOGRAPHIC. THE LANGUAGE OF THIS PRESS AS A WHOLE HAD THE ACCENT
OF A FOREIGN PEOPLE. THE GENERAL TONE WAS OPENLY DEROGATORY TO THE
GERMANS AND THIS MUST HAVE BEEN DEFINITELY INTENTIONAL.

WHAT WERE THE INTERESTS THAT URGED THE VIENNA PRESS TO ADOPT SUCH A
POLICY? OR DID THEY DO SO MERELY BY CHANCE? IN ATTEMPTING TO FIND AN
ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS I GRADUALLY BECAME MORE AND MORE DUBIOUS.

THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED WHICH HELPED ME TO COME TO AN EARLY DECISION. I
BEGAN TO SEE THROUGH THE MEANING OF A WHOLE SERIES OF EVENTS THAT WERE
TAKING PLACE IN OTHER BRANCHES OF VIENNESE LIFE. ALL THESE WERE INSPIRED
BY A GENERAL CONCEPT OF MANNERS AND MORALS WHICH WAS OPENLY PUT INTO
PRACTICE BY A LARGE SECTION OF THE JEWS AND COULD BE ESTABLISHED AS
ATTRIBUTABLE TO THEM. HERE, AGAIN, THE LIFE WHICH I OBSERVED ON THE
STREETS TAUGHT ME WHAT EVIL REALLY IS.

THE PART WHICH THE JEWS PLAYED IN THE SOCIAL PHENOMENON OF PROSTITUTION,
AND MORE ESPECIALLY IN THE WHITE SLAVE TRAFFIC, COULD BE STUDIED HERE
BETTER THAN IN ANY OTHER WEST-EUROPEAN CITY, WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION
OF CERTAIN PORTS IN SOUTHERN FRANCE. WALKING BY NIGHT ALONG THE STREETS
OF THE LEOPOLDSTADT, ALMOST AT EVERY TURN WHETHER ONE WISHED IT OR NOT,
ONE WITNESSED CERTAIN HAPPENINGS OF WHOSE EXISTENCE THE GERMANS KNEW
NOTHING UNTIL THE WAR MADE IT POSSIBLE AND INDEED INEVITABLE FOR THE
SOLDIERS TO SEE SUCH THINGS ON THE EASTERN FRONT.

A COLD SHIVER RAN DOWN MY SPINE WHEN I FIRST ASCERTAINED THAT IT WAS THE
SAME KIND OF COLD-BLOODED, THICK-SKINNED AND SHAMELESS JEW WHO SHOWED
HIS CONSUMMATE SKILL IN CONDUCTING THAT REVOLTING EXPLOITATION OF THE
DREGS OF THE BIG CITY. THEN I BECAME FIRED WITH WRATH.

I HAD NOW NO MORE HESITATION ABOUT BRINGING THE JEWISH PROBLEM TO LIGHT
IN ALL ITS DETAILS. NO. HENCEFORTH I WAS DETERMINED TO DO SO. BUT AS I
LEARNED TO TRACK DOWN THE JEW IN ALL THE DIFFERENT SPHERES OF CULTURAL
AND ARTISTIC LIFE, AND IN THE VARIOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF THIS LIFE
EVERYWHERE, I SUDDENLY CAME UPON HIM IN A POSITION WHERE I HAD LEAST
EXPECTED TO FIND HIM. I NOW REALIZED THAT THE JEWS WERE THE LEADERS OF
SOCIAL DEMOCRACY. IN FACE OF THAT REVELATION THE SCALES FELL FROM MY
EYES. MY LONG INNER STRUGGLE WAS AT AN END.

IN MY RELATIONS WITH MY FELLOW WORKMEN I WAS OFTEN ASTONISHED TO FIND
HOW EASILY AND OFTEN THEY CHANGED THEIR OPINIONS ON THE SAME QUESTIONS,
SOMETIMES WITHIN A FEW DAYS AND SOMETIMES EVEN WITHIN THE COURSE OF A
FEW HOURS. I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW MEN WHO ALWAYS HAD
REASONABLE IDEAS WHEN THEY SPOKE AS INDIVIDUALS WITH ONE ANOTHER
SUDDENLY LOST THIS REASONABLENESS THE MOMENT THEY ACTED IN THE MASS.
THAT PHENOMENON OFTEN TEMPTED ONE ALMOST TO DESPAIR. I USED TO DISPUTE
WITH THEM FOR HOURS AND WHEN I SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING THEM TO WHAT I
CONSIDERED A REASONABLE WAY OF THINKING I REJOICED AT MY SUCCESS. BUT
NEXT DAY I WOULD FIND THAT IT HAD BEEN ALL IN VAIN. IT WAS SADDENING TO
THINK I HAD TO BEGIN IT ALL OVER AGAIN. LIKE A PENDULUM IN ITS ETERNAL
SWAY, THEY WOULD FALL BACK INTO THEIR ABSURD OPINIONS.

I WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR POSITION FULLY. THEY WERE DISSATISFIED
WITH THEIR LOT AND CURSED THE FATE WHICH HAD HIT THEM SO HARD. THEY
HATED THEIR EMPLOYERS, WHOM THEY LOOKED UPON AS THE HEARTLESS
ADMINISTRATORS OF THEIR CRUEL DESTINY. OFTEN THEY USED ABUSIVE LANGUAGE
AGAINST THE PUBLIC OFFICIALS, WHOM THEY ACCUSED OF HAVING NO SYMPATHY
WITH THE SITUATION OF THE WORKING PEOPLE. THEY MADE PUBLIC PROTESTS
AGAINST THE COST OF LIVING AND PARADED THROUGH THE STREETS IN DEFENCE OF
THEIR CLAIMS. AT LEAST ALL THIS COULD BE EXPLAINED ON REASONABLE
GROUNDS. BUT WHAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND WAS THE BOUNDLESS HATRED
THEY EXPRESSED AGAINST THEIR OWN FELLOW CITIZENS, HOW THEY DISPARAGED
THEIR OWN NATION, MOCKED AT ITS GREATNESS, REVILED ITS HISTORY AND
DRAGGED THE NAMES OF ITS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS MEN IN THE GUTTER.

THIS HOSTILITY TOWARDS THEIR OWN KITH AND KIN, THEIR OWN NATIVE LAND AND
HOME WAS AS IRRATIONAL AS IT WAS INCOMPREHENSIBLE. IT WAS AGAINST
NATURE.

ONE COULD CURE THAT MALADY TEMPORARILY, BUT ONLY FOR SOME DAYS OR AT
LEAST SOME WEEKS. BUT ON MEETING THOSE WHOM ONE BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN
CONVERTED ONE FOUND THAT THEY HAD BECOME AS THEY WERE BEFORE. THAT
MALADY AGAINST NATURE HELD THEM ONCE AGAIN IN ITS CLUTCHES.

I GRADUALLY DISCOVERED THAT THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PRESS WAS
PREDOMINANTLY CONTROLLED BY JEWS. BUT I DID NOT ATTACH SPECIAL
IMPORTANCE TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, FOR THE SAME STATE OF AFFAIRS EXISTED
ALSO IN OTHER NEWSPAPERS. BUT THERE WAS ONE STRIKING FACT IN THIS
CONNECTION. IT WAS THAT THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE NEWSPAPER WITH WHICH JEWS
WERE CONNECTED THAT COULD BE SPOKEN OF AS NATIONAL, IN THE MEANING THAT
MY EDUCATION AND CONVICTIONS ATTACHED TO THAT WORD.

MAKING AN EFFORT TO OVERCOME MY NATURAL RELUCTANCE, I TRIED TO READ
ARTICLES OF THIS NATURE PUBLISHED IN THE MARXIST PRESS; BUT IN DOING SO
MY AVERSION INCREASED ALL THE MORE. AND THEN I SET ABOUT LEARNING
SOMETHING OF THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE AND PUBLISHED THIS MISCHIEVOUS STUFF.
FROM THE PUBLISHER DOWNWARDS, ALL OF THEM WERE JEWS. I RECALLED TO MIND
THE NAMES OF THE PUBLIC LEADERS OF MARXISM, AND THEN I REALIZED THAT
MOST OF THEM BELONGED TO THE CHOSEN RACE--THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC
REPRESENTATIVES IN THE IMPERIAL CABINET AS WELL AS THE SECRETARIES OF
THE TRADES UNIONS AND THE STREET AGITATORS. EVERYWHERE THE SAME SINISTER
PICTURE PRESENTED ITSELF. I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE ROW OF
NAMES--AUSTERLITZ, DAVID, ADLER, ELLENBOGEN, AND OTHERS. ONE FACT BECAME
QUITE EVIDENT TO ME. IT WAS THAT THIS ALIEN RACE HELD IN ITS HANDS THE
LEADERSHIP OF THAT SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY WITH WHOSE MINOR
REPRESENTATIVES I HAD BEEN DISPUTING FOR MONTHS PAST. I WAS HAPPY AT
LAST TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT THE JEW IS NOT A GERMAN.

THUS I FINALLY DISCOVERED WHO WERE THE EVIL SPIRITS LEADING OUR PEOPLE
ASTRAY. THE SOJOURN IN VIENNA FOR ONE YEAR HAD PROVED LONG ENOUGH TO
CONVINCE ME THAT NO WORKER IS SO ROOTED IN HIS PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS THAT
HE WILL NOT SURRENDER THEM IN FACE OF BETTER AND CLEARER ARGUMENTS AND
EXPLANATIONS. GRADUALLY I BECAME AN EXPERT IN THE DOCTRINE OF THE
MARXISTS AND USED THIS KNOWLEDGE AS AN INSTRUMENT TO DRIVE HOME MY OWN
FIRM CONVICTIONS. I WAS SUCCESSFUL IN NEARLY EVERY CASE. THE GREAT
MASSES CAN BE RESCUED, BUT A LOT OF TIME AND A LARGE SHARE OF HUMAN
PATIENCE MUST BE DEVOTED TO SUCH WORK.

BUT A JEW CAN NEVER BE RESCUED FROM HIS FIXED NOTIONS.

IT WAS THEN SIMPLE ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT TO SHOW THEM THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR
TEACHING. WITHIN MY SMALL CIRCLE I TALKED TO THEM UNTIL MY THROAT ACHED
AND MY VOICE GREW HOARSE. I BELIEVED THAT I COULD FINALLY CONVINCE THEM
OF THE DANGER INHERENT IN THE MARXIST FOLLIES. BUT I ONLY ACHIEVED THE
CONTRARY RESULT. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IMMEDIATELY THE DISASTROUS EFFECTS
OF THE MARXIST THEORY AND ITS APPLICATION IN PRACTICE BECAME EVIDENT,
THE STRONGER BECAME THEIR OBSTINACY.

THE MORE I DEBATED WITH THEM THE MORE FAMILIAR I BECAME WITH THEIR
ARGUMENTATIVE TACTICS. AT THE OUTSET THEY COUNTED UPON THE STUPIDITY OF
THEIR OPPONENTS, BUT WHEN THEY GOT SO ENTANGLED THAT THEY COULD NOT FIND
A WAY OUT THEY PLAYED THE TRICK OF ACTING AS INNOCENT SIMPLETONS. SHOULD
THEY FAIL, IN SPITE OF THEIR TRICKS OF LOGIC, THEY ACTED AS IF THEY
COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE COUNTER ARGUMENTS AND BOLTED AWAY TO ANOTHER
FIELD OF DISCUSSION. THEY WOULD LAY DOWN TRUISMS AND PLATITUDES; AND, IF
YOU ACCEPTED THESE, THEN THEY WERE APPLIED TO OTHER PROBLEMS AND MATTERS
OF AN ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT NATURE FROM THE ORIGINAL THEME. IF YOU FACED
THEM WITH THIS POINT THEY WOULD ESCAPE AGAIN, AND YOU COULD NOT BRING
THEM TO MAKE ANY PRECISE STATEMENT. WHENEVER ONE TRIED TO GET A FIRM
GRIP ON ANY OF THESE APOSTLES ONE'S HAND GRASPED ONLY JELLY AND SLIME
WHICH SLIPPED THROUGH THE FINGERS AND COMBINED AGAIN INTO A SOLID MASS A
MOMENT AFTERWARDS. IF YOUR ADVERSARY FELT FORCED TO GIVE IN TO YOUR
ARGUMENT, ON ACCOUNT OF THE OBSERVERS PRESENT, AND IF YOU THEN THOUGHT
THAT AT LAST YOU HAD GAINED GROUND, A SURPRISE WAS IN STORE FOR YOU ON
THE FOLLOWING DAY. THE JEW WOULD BE UTTERLY OBLIVIOUS TO WHAT HAD
HAPPENED THE DAY BEFORE, AND HE WOULD START ONCE AGAIN BY REPEATING HIS
FORMER ABSURDITIES, AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. SHOULD YOU BECOME
INDIGNANT AND REMIND HIM OF YESTERDAY'S DEFEAT, HE PRETENDED
ASTONISHMENT AND COULD NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING, EXCEPT THAT ON THE
PREVIOUS DAY HE HAD PROVED THAT HIS STATEMENTS WERE CORRECT. SOMETIMES I
WAS DUMBFOUNDED. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT AMAZED ME THE MORE--THE ABUNDANCE OF
THEIR VERBIAGE OR THE ARTFUL WAY IN WHICH THEY DRESSED UP THEIR
FALSEHOODS. I GRADUALLY CAME TO HATE THEM.

YET ALL THIS HAD ITS GOOD SIDE; BECAUSE THE MORE I CAME TO KNOW THE
INDIVIDUAL LEADERS, OR AT LEAST THE PROPAGANDISTS, OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY,
MY LOVE FOR MY OWN PEOPLE INCREASED CORRESPONDINGLY. CONSIDERING THE
SATANIC SKILL WHICH THESE EVIL COUNSELLORS DISPLAYED, HOW COULD THEIR
UNFORTUNATE VICTIMS BE BLAMED? INDEED, I FOUND IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT
MYSELF TO BE A MATCH FOR THE DIALECTICAL PERFIDY OF THAT RACE. HOW
FUTILE IT WAS TO TRY TO WIN OVER SUCH PEOPLE WITH ARGUMENT, SEEING THAT
THEIR VERY MOUTHS DISTORTED THE TRUTH, DISOWNING THE VERY WORDS THEY HAD
JUST USED AND ADOPTING THEM AGAIN A FEW MOMENTS AFTERWARDS TO SERVE
THEIR OWN ENDS IN THE ARGUMENT! NO. THE MORE I CAME TO KNOW THE JEW, THE
EASIER IT WAS TO EXCUSE THE WORKERS.

IN MY OPINION THE MOST CULPABLE WERE NOT TO BE FOUND AMONG THE WORKERS
BUT RATHER AMONG THOSE WHO DID NOT THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO TAKE THE
TROUBLE TO SYMPATHIZE WITH THEIR OWN KINSFOLK AND GIVE TO THE
HARD-WORKING SON OF THE NATIONAL FAMILY WHAT WAS HIS BY THE IRON LOGIC
OF JUSTICE, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PLACING HIS SEDUCER AND CORRUPTER
AGAINST THE WALL.

URGED BY MY OWN DAILY EXPERIENCES, I NOW BEGAN TO INVESTIGATE MORE
THOROUGHLY THE SOURCES OF THE MARXIST TEACHING ITSELF. ITS EFFECTS WERE
WELL KNOWN TO ME IN DETAIL. AS A RESULT OF CAREFUL OBSERVATION, ITS
DAILY PROGRESS HAD BECOME OBVIOUS TO ME. AND ONE NEEDED ONLY A LITTLE
IMAGINATION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FORECAST THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH MUST
RESULT FROM IT. THE ONLY QUESTION NOW WAS: DID THE FOUNDERS FORESEE THE
EFFECTS OF THEIR WORK IN THE FORM WHICH THOSE EFFECTS HAVE SHOWN
THEMSELVES TO-DAY, OR WERE THE FOUNDERS THEMSELVES THE VICTIMS OF AN
ERROR? TO MY MIND BOTH ALTERNATIVES WERE POSSIBLE.

IF THE SECOND QUESTION MUST BE ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THEN IT WAS
THE DUTY OF EVERY THINKING PERSON TO OPPOSE THIS SINISTER MOVEMENT WITH
A VIEW TO PREVENTING IT FROM PRODUCING ITS WORST RESULTS. BUT IF THE
FIRST QUESTION MUST BE ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THEN IT MUST BE
ADMITTED THAT THE ORIGINAL AUTHORS OF THIS EVIL WHICH HAS INFECTED THE
NATIONS WERE DEVILS INCARNATE. FOR ONLY IN THE BRAIN OF A MONSTER, AND
NOT THAT OF A MAN, COULD THE PLAN OF THIS ORGANIZATION TAKE SHAPE WHOSE
WORKINGS MUST FINALLY BRING ABOUT THE COLLAPSE OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION AND
TURN THIS WORLD INTO A DESERT WASTE.

SUCH BEING THE CASE THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE LEFT WAS TO FIGHT, AND IN THAT
FIGHT TO EMPLOY ALL THE WEAPONS WHICH THE HUMAN SPIRIT AND INTELLECT AND
WILL COULD FURNISH LEAVING IT TO FATE TO DECIDE IN WHOSE FAVOUR THE
BALANCE SHOULD FALL.

AND SO I BEGAN TO GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE AUTHORS OF THIS TEACHING,
WITH A VIEW TO STUDYING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE MOVEMENT. THE FACT THAT I
ATTAINED MY OBJECT SOONER THAN I COULD HAVE ANTICIPATED WAS DUE TO THE
DEEPER INSIGHT INTO THE JEWISH QUESTION WHICH I THEN GAINED, MY
KNOWLEDGE OF THIS QUESTION BEING HITHERTO RATHER SUPERFICIAL. THIS NEWLY
ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE ALONE ENABLED ME TO MAKE A PRACTICAL COMPARISON
BETWEEN THE REAL CONTENT AND THE THEORETICAL PRETENTIOUSNESS OF THE
TEACHING LAID DOWN BY THE APOSTOLIC FOUNDERS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY;
BECAUSE I NOW UNDERSTOOD THE LANGUAGE OF THE JEW. I REALIZED THAT THE
JEW USES LANGUAGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISSIMULATING HIS THOUGHT OR AT
LEAST VEILING IT, SO THAT HIS REAL AIM CANNOT BE DISCOVERED BY WHAT HE
SAYS BUT RATHER BY READING BETWEEN THE LINES. THIS KNOWLEDGE WAS THE
OCCASION OF THE GREATEST INNER REVOLUTION THAT I HAD YET EXPERIENCED.
FROM BEING A SOFT-HEARTED COSMOPOLITAN I BECAME AN OUT-AND-OUT
ANTI-SEMITE.

ONLY ON ONE FURTHER OCCASION, AND THAT FOR THE LAST TIME, DID I GIVE WAY
TO OPPRESSING THOUGHTS WHICH CAUSED ME SOME MOMENTS OF PROFOUND ANXIETY.

AS I CRITICALLY REVIEWED THE ACTIVITIES OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE THROUGHOUT
LONG PERIODS OF HISTORY I BECAME ANXIOUS AND ASKED MYSELF WHETHER FOR
SOME INSCRUTABLE REASONS BEYOND THE COMPREHENSION OF POOR MORTALS SUCH
AS OURSELVES, DESTINY MAY NOT HAVE IRREVOCABLY DECREED THAT THE FINAL
VICTORY MUST GO TO THIS SMALL NATION? MAY IT NOT BE THAT THIS PEOPLE
WHICH HAS LIVED ONLY FOR THE EARTH HAS BEEN PROMISED THE EARTH AS A
RECOMPENSE? IS OUR RIGHT TO STRUGGLE FOR OUR OWN SELF-PRESERVATION BASED
ON REALITY, OR IS IT A MERELY SUBJECTIVE THING? FATE ANSWERED THE
QUESTION FOR ME INASMUCH AS IT LED ME TO MAKE A DETACHED AND EXHAUSTIVE
INQUIRY INTO THE MARXIST TEACHING AND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE JEWISH
PEOPLE IN CONNECTION WITH IT.

THE JEWISH DOCTRINE OF MARXISM REPUDIATES THE ARISTOCRATIC PRINCIPLE OF
NATURE AND SUBSTITUTES FOR IT THE ETERNAL PRIVILEGE OF FORCE AND ENERGY,
NUMERICAL MASS AND ITS DEAD WEIGHT. THUS IT DENIES THE INDIVIDUAL WORTH
OF THE HUMAN PERSONALITY, IMPUGNS THE TEACHING THAT NATIONHOOD AND RACE
HAVE A PRIMARY SIGNIFICANCE, AND BY DOING THIS IT TAKES AWAY THE VERY
FOUNDATIONS OF HUMAN EXISTENCE AND HUMAN CIVILIZATION. IF THE MARXIST
TEACHING WERE TO BE ACCEPTED AS THE FOUNDATION OF THE LIFE OF THE
UNIVERSE, IT WOULD LEAD TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ALL ORDER THAT IS
CONCEIVABLE TO THE HUMAN MIND. AND THUS THE ADOPTION OF SUCH A LAW WOULD
PROVOKE CHAOS IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE GREATEST ORGANISM THAT WE KNOW,
WITH THE RESULT THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THIS EARTHLY PLANET WOULD
FINALLY DISAPPEAR.

SHOULD THE JEW, WITH THE AID OF HIS MARXIST CREED, TRIUMPH OVER THE
PEOPLE OF THIS WORLD, HIS CROWN WILL BE THE FUNERAL WREATH OF MANKIND,
AND THIS PLANET WILL ONCE AGAIN FOLLOW ITS ORBIT THROUGH ETHER, WITHOUT
ANY HUMAN LIFE ON ITS SURFACE, AS IT DID MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO.

AND SO I BELIEVE TO-DAY THAT MY CONDUCT IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WILL
OF THE ALMIGHTY CREATOR. IN STANDING GUARD AGAINST THE JEW I AM
DEFENDING THE HANDIWORK OF THE LORD.




CHAPTER III



POLITICAL REFLECTIONS ARISING OUT OF MY SOJOURN IN VIENNA


GENERALLY SPEAKING A MAN SHOULD NOT PUBLICLY TAKE PART IN POLITICS
BEFORE HE HAS REACHED THE AGE OF THIRTY, THOUGH, OF COURSE, EXCEPTIONS
MUST BE MADE IN THE CASE OF THOSE WHO ARE NATURALLY GIFTED WITH
EXTRAORDINARY POLITICAL ABILITIES. THAT AT LEAST IS MY OPINION TO-DAY.
AND THE REASON FOR IT IS THAT UNTIL HE REACHES HIS THIRTIETH YEAR OR
THEREABOUTS A MAN'S MENTAL DEVELOPMENT WILL MOSTLY CONSIST IN ACQUIRING
AND SIFTING SUCH KNOWLEDGE AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE GROUNDWORK OF A
GENERAL PLATFORM FROM WHICH HE CAN EXAMINE THE DIFFERENT POLITICAL
PROBLEMS THAT ARISE FROM DAY TO DAY AND BE ABLE TO ADOPT A DEFINITE
ATTITUDE TOWARDS EACH. A MAN MUST FIRST ACQUIRE A FUND OF GENERAL IDEAS
AND FIT THEM TOGETHER SO AS TO FORM AN ORGANIC STRUCTURE OF PERSONAL
THOUGHT OR OUTLOOK ON LIFE--A WELTANSCHAUUNG. THEN HE WILL HAVE THAT
MENTAL EQUIPMENT WITHOUT WHICH HE CANNOT FORM HIS OWN JUDGMENTS ON
PARTICULAR QUESTIONS OF THE DAY, AND HE WILL HAVE ACQUIRED THOSE
QUALITIES THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR CONSISTENCY AND STEADFASTNESS IN THE
FORMATION OF POLITICAL OPINIONS. SUCH A MAN IS NOW QUALIFIED, AT LEAST
SUBJECTIVELY, TO TAKE HIS PART IN THE POLITICAL CONDUCT OF PUBLIC
AFFAIRS.

IF THESE PRE-REQUISITE CONDITIONS ARE NOT FULFILLED, AND IF A MAN SHOULD
ENTER POLITICAL LIFE WITHOUT THIS EQUIPMENT, HE WILL RUN A TWOFOLD RISK.
IN THE FIRST PLACE, HE MAY FIND DURING THE COURSE OF EVENTS THAT THE
STAND WHICH HE ORIGINALLY TOOK IN REGARD TO SOME ESSENTIAL QUESTION WAS
WRONG. HE WILL NOW HAVE TO ABANDON HIS FORMER POSITION OR ELSE STICK TO
IT AGAINST HIS BETTER KNOWLEDGE AND RIPER WISDOM AND AFTER HIS REASON
AND CONVICTIONS HAVE ALREADY PROVED IT UNTENABLE. IF HE ADOPT THE FORMER
LINE OF ACTION HE WILL FIND HIMSELF IN A DIFFICULT PERSONAL SITUATION;
BECAUSE IN GIVING UP A POSITION HITHERTO MAINTAINED HE WILL APPEAR
INCONSISTENT AND WILL HAVE NO RIGHT TO EXPECT HIS FOLLOWERS TO REMAIN AS
LOYAL TO HIS LEADERSHIP AS THEY WERE BEFORE. AND, AS REGARDS THE
FOLLOWERS THEMSELVES, THEY MAY EASILY LOOK UPON THEIR LEADER'S CHANGE OF
POLICY AS SHOWING A LACK OF JUDGMENT INHERENT IN HIS CHARACTER.
MOREOVER, THE CHANGE MUST CAUSE IN THEM A CERTAIN FEELING OF
DISCOMFITURE VIS-Ã€-VIS THOSE WHOM THE LEADER FORMERLY OPPOSED.

IF HE ADOPTS THE SECOND ALTERNATIVE--WHICH SO VERY FREQUENTLY HAPPENS
TO-DAY--THEN PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS OF THE LEADER HAVE NO LONGER HIS
PERSONAL PERSUASION TO SUPPORT THEM. AND THE MORE THAT IS THE CASE THE
DEFENCE OF HIS CAUSE WILL BE ALL THE MORE HOLLOW AND SUPERFICIAL. HE NOW
DESCENDS TO THE ADOPTION OF VULGAR MEANS IN HIS DEFENCE. WHILE HE
HIMSELF NO LONGER DREAMS SERIOUSLY OF STANDING BY HIS POLITICAL
PROTESTATIONS TO THE LAST--FOR NO MAN WILL DIE IN DEFENCE OF SOMETHING
IN WHICH HE DOES NOT BELIEVE--HE MAKES INCREASING DEMANDS ON HIS
FOLLOWERS. INDEED, THE GREATER BE THE MEASURE OF HIS OWN INSINCERITY,
THE MORE UNFORTUNATE AND INCONSIDERATE BECOME HIS CLAIMS ON HIS PARTY
ADHERENTS. FINALLY, HE THROWS ASIDE THE LAST VESTIGES OF TRUE LEADERSHIP
AND BEGINS TO PLAY POLITICS. THIS MEANS THAT HE BECOMES ONE OF THOSE
WHOSE ONLY CONSISTENCY IS THEIR INCONSISTENCY, ASSOCIATED WITH
OVERBEARING INSOLENCE AND OFTENTIMES AN ARTFUL MENDACITY DEVELOPED TO A
SHAMELESSLY HIGH DEGREE.

SHOULD SUCH A PERSON, TO THE MISFORTUNE OF ALL DECENT PEOPLE, SUCCEED IN
BECOMING A PARLIAMENTARY DEPUTY IT WILL BE CLEAR FROM THE OUTSET THAT
FOR HIM THE ESSENCE OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY CONSISTS IN A HEROIC STRUGGLE
TO KEEP PERMANENT HOLD ON THIS MILK-BOTTLE AS A SOURCE OF LIVELIHOOD FOR
HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY. THE MORE HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN ARE DEPENDENT ON
HIM, THE MORE STUBBORNLY WILL HE FIGHT TO MAINTAIN FOR HIMSELF THE
REPRESENTATION OF HIS PARLIAMENTARY CONSTITUENCY. FOR THAT REASON ANY
OTHER PERSON WHO GIVES EVIDENCE OF POLITICAL CAPACITY IS HIS PERSONAL
ENEMY. IN EVERY NEW MOVEMENT HE WILL APPREHEND THE POSSIBLE BEGINNING OF
HIS OWN DOWNFALL. AND EVERYONE WHO IS A BETTER MAN THAN HIMSELF WILL
APPEAR TO HIM IN THE LIGHT OF A MENACE.

I SHALL SUBSEQUENTLY DEAL MORE FULLY WITH THE PROBLEM TO WHICH THIS KIND
OF PARLIAMENTARY VERMIN GIVE RISE.

WHEN A MAN HAS REACHED HIS THIRTIETH YEAR HE HAS STILL A GREAT DEAL TO
LEARN. THAT IS OBVIOUS. BUT HENCEFORWARD WHAT HE LEARNS WILL PRINCIPALLY
BE AN AMPLIFICATION OF HIS BASIC IDEAS; IT WILL BE FITTED IN WITH THEM
ORGANICALLY SO AS TO FILL UP THE FRAMEWORK OF THE FUNDAMENTAL
WELTANSCHAUUNG WHICH HE ALREADY POSSESSES. WHAT HE LEARNS ANEW WILL NOT
IMPLY THE ABANDONMENT OF PRINCIPLES ALREADY HELD, BUT RATHER A DEEPER
KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE PRINCIPLES. AND THUS HIS COLLEAGUES WILL NEVER HAVE
THE DISCOMFORTING FEELING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN HITHERTO FALSELY LED BY
HIM. ON THE CONTRARY, THEIR CONFIDENCE IS INCREASED WHEN THEY PERCEIVE
THAT THEIR LEADER'S QUALITIES ARE STEADILY DEVELOPING ALONG THE LINES OF
AN ORGANIC GROWTH WHICH RESULTS FROM THE CONSTANT ASSIMILATION OF NEW
IDEAS; SO THAT THE FOLLOWERS LOOK UPON THIS PROCESS AS SIGNIFYING AN
ENRICHMENT OF THE DOCTRINES IN WHICH THEY THEMSELVES BELIEVE, IN THEIR
EYES EVERY SUCH DEVELOPMENT IS A NEW WITNESS TO THE CORRECTNESS OF THAT
WHOLE BODY OF OPINION WHICH HAS HITHERTO BEEN HELD.

A LEADER WHO HAS TO ABANDON THE PLATFORM FOUNDED ON HIS GENERAL
PRINCIPLES, BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZES THE FOUNDATION AS FALSE, CAN ACT WITH
HONOUR ONLY WHEN HE DECLARES HIS READINESS TO ACCEPT THE FINAL
CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ERRONEOUS VIEWS. IN SUCH A CASE HE OUGHT TO REFRAIN
FROM TAKING PUBLIC PART IN ANY FURTHER POLITICAL ACTIVITY. HAVING ONCE
GONE ASTRAY ON ESSENTIAL THINGS HE MAY POSSIBLY GO ASTRAY A SECOND TIME.
BUT, ANYHOW, HE HAS NO RIGHT WHATSOEVER TO EXPECT OR DEMAND THAT HIS
FELLOW CITIZENS SHOULD CONTINUE TO GIVE HIM THEIR SUPPORT.

HOW LITTLE SUCH A LINE OF CONDUCT COMMENDS ITSELF TO OUR PUBLIC LEADERS
NOWADAYS IS PROVED BY THE GENERAL CORRUPTION PREVALENT AMONG THE CABAL
WHICH AT THE PRESENT MOMENT FEELS ITSELF CALLED TO POLITICAL LEADERSHIP.
IN THE WHOLE CABAL THERE IS SCARCELY ONE WHO IS PROPERLY EQUIPPED FOR
THIS TASK.

ALTHOUGH IN THOSE DAYS I USED TO GIVE MORE TIME THAN MOST OTHERS TO THE
CONSIDERATION OF POLITICAL QUESTION, YET I CAREFULLY REFRAINED FROM
TAKING AN OPEN PART IN POLITICS. ONLY TO A SMALL CIRCLE DID I SPEAK OF
THOSE THINGS WHICH AGITATED MY MIND OR WERE THE CAUSE OF CONSTANT
PREOCCUPATION FOR ME. THE HABIT OF DISCUSSING MATTERS WITHIN SUCH A
RESTRICTED GROUP HAD MANY ADVANTAGES IN ITSELF. RATHER THAN TALK AT
THEM, I LEARNED TO FEEL MY WAY INTO THE MODES OF THOUGHT AND VIEWS OF
THOSE MEN AROUND ME. OFTENTIMES SUCH WAYS OF THINKING AND SUCH VIEWS
WERE QUITE PRIMITIVE. THUS I TOOK EVERY POSSIBLE OCCASION TO INCREASE MY
KNOWLEDGE OF MEN.

NOWHERE AMONG THE GERMAN PEOPLE WAS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MAKING SUCH A
STUDY SO FAVOURABLE AS IN VIENNA.

IN THE OLD DANUBIAN MONARCHY POLITICAL THOUGHT WAS WIDER IN ITS RANGE
AND HAD A RICHER VARIETY OF INTERESTS THAN IN THE GERMANY OF THAT
EPOCH--EXCEPTING CERTAIN PARTS OF PRUSSIA, HAMBURG AND THE DISTRICTS
BORDERING ON THE NORTH SEA. WHEN I SPEAK OF AUSTRIA HERE I MEAN THAT
PART OF THE GREAT HABSBURG EMPIRE WHICH, BY REASON OF ITS GERMAN
POPULATION, FURNISHED NOT ONLY THE HISTORIC BASIS FOR THE FORMATION OF
THIS STATE BUT WHOSE POPULATION WAS FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES ALSO THE
EXCLUSIVE SOURCE OF CULTURAL LIFE IN THAT POLITICAL SYSTEM WHOSE
STRUCTURE WAS SO ARTIFICIAL. AS TIME WENT ON THE STABILITY OF THE
AUSTRIAN STATE AND THE GUARANTEE OF ITS CONTINUED EXISTENCE DEPENDED
MORE AND MORE ON THE MAINTENANCE OF THIS GERM-CELL OF THAT HABSBURG
EMPIRE.

THE HEREDITARY IMPERIAL PROVINCES CONSTITUTED THE HEART OF THE EMPIRE.
AND IT WAS THIS HEART THAT CONSTANTLY SENT THE BLOOD OF LIFE PULSATING
THROUGH THE WHOLE POLITICAL AND CULTURAL SYSTEM. CORRESPONDING TO THE
HEART OF THE EMPIRE, VIENNA SIGNIFIED THE BRAIN AND THE WILL. AT THAT
TIME VIENNA PRESENTED AN APPEARANCE WHICH MADE ONE THINK OF HER AS AN
ENTHRONED QUEEN WHOSE AUTHORITATIVE SWAY UNITED THE CONGLOMERATION OF
HETEROGENOUS NATIONALITIES THAT LIVED UNDER THE HABSBURG SCEPTRE. THE
RADIANT BEAUTY OF THE CAPITAL CITY MADE ONE FORGET THE SAD SYMPTOMS OF
SENILE DECAY WHICH THE STATE MANIFESTED AS A WHOLE.

THOUGH THE EMPIRE WAS INTERNALLY RICKETY BECAUSE OF THE TERRIFIC
CONFLICT GOING ON BETWEEN THE VARIOUS NATIONALITIES, THE OUTSIDE
WORLD--AND GERMANY IN PARTICULAR--SAW ONLY THAT LOVELY PICTURE OF THE
CITY. THE ILLUSION WAS ALL THE GREATER BECAUSE AT THAT TIME VIENNA
SEEMED TO HAVE RISEN TO ITS HIGHEST PITCH OF SPLENDOUR. UNDER A MAYOR,
WHO HAD THE TRUE STAMP OF ADMINISTRATIVE GENIUS, THE VENERABLE
RESIDENTIAL CITY OF THE EMPERORS OF THE OLD EMPIRE SEEMED TO HAVE THE
GLORY OF ITS YOUTH RENEWED. THE LAST GREAT GERMAN WHO SPRANG FROM THE
RANKS OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAD COLONIZED THE EAST MARK WAS NOT A
'STATESMAN', IN THE OFFICIAL SENSE. THIS DR. LUEGAR, HOWEVER, IN HIS
RÃ´LE AS MAYOR OF 'THE IMPERIAL CAPITAL AND RESIDENTIAL CITY', HAD
ACHIEVED SO MUCH IN ALMOST ALL SPHERES OF MUNICIPAL ACTIVITY, WHETHER
ECONOMIC OR CULTURAL, THAT THE HEART OF THE WHOLE EMPIRE THROBBED WITH
RENEWED VIGOUR. HE THUS PROVED HIMSELF A MUCH GREATER STATESMAN THAN THE
SO-CALLED 'DIPLOMATS' OF THAT PERIOD.

THE FACT THAT THIS POLITICAL SYSTEM OF HETEROGENEOUS RACES CALLED
AUSTRIA, FINALLY BROKE DOWN IS NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER OF POLITICAL
INCAPACITY ON THE PART OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT IN THE OLD EAST MARK. THE
COLLAPSE WAS THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION. TEN
MILLION PEOPLE CANNOT PERMANENTLY HOLD TOGETHER A STATE OF FIFTY
MILLIONS, COMPOSED OF DIFFERENT AND CONVICTING NATIONALITIES, UNLESS
CERTAIN DEFINITE PRE-REQUISITE CONDITIONS ARE AT HAND WHILE THERE IS
STILL TIME TO AVAIL OF THEM.

THE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN HAD VERY BIG WAYS OF THINKING. ACCUSTOMED TO LIVE IN
A GREAT EMPIRE, HE HAD A KEEN SENSE OF THE OBLIGATIONS INCUMBENT ON HIM
IN SUCH A SITUATION. HE WAS THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE AUSTRIAN STATE WHO
LOOKED BEYOND THE BORDERS OF THE NARROW LANDS BELONGING TO THE CROWN AND
TOOK IN ALL THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE IN THE SWEEP OF HIS MIND. INDEED
WHEN DESTINY SEVERED HIM FROM THE COMMON FATHERLAND HE TRIED TO MASTER
THE TREMENDOUS TASK WHICH WAS SET BEFORE HIM AS A CONSEQUENCE. THIS TASK
WAS TO MAINTAIN FOR THE GERMAN-AUSTRIANS THAT PATRIMONY WHICH, THROUGH
INNUMERABLE STRUGGLES, THEIR ANCESTORS HAD ORIGINALLY WRESTED FROM THE
EAST. IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE GERMAN-AUSTRIANS COULD NOT PUT
THEIR UNDIVIDED STRENGTH INTO THIS EFFORT, BECAUSE THE HEARTS AND MINDS
OF THE BEST AMONG THEM WERE CONSTANTLY TURNING BACK TOWARDS THEIR
KINSFOLK IN THE MOTHERLAND, SO THAT ONLY A FRACTION OF THEIR ENERGY
REMAINED TO BE EMPLOYED AT HOME.

THE MENTAL HORIZON OF THE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN WAS COMPARATIVELY BROAD. HIS
COMMERCIAL INTERESTS COMPRISED ALMOST EVERY SECTION OF THE HETEROGENEOUS
EMPIRE. THE CONDUCT OF ALMOST ALL IMPORTANT UNDERTAKINGS WAS IN HIS
HANDS. HE PROVIDED THE STATE, FOR THE MOST PART, WITH ITS LEADING
TECHNICAL EXPERTS AND CIVIL SERVANTS. HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR CARRYING ON
THE FOREIGN TRADE OF THE COUNTRY, AS FAR AS THAT SPHERE OF ACTIVITY WAS
NOT UNDER JEWISH CONTROL, THE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN EXCLUSIVELY REPRESENTED
THE POLITICAL CEMENT THAT HELD THE STATE TOGETHER. HIS MILITARY DUTIES
CARRIED HIM FAR BEYOND THE NARROW FRONTIERS OF HIS HOMELAND. THOUGH THE
RECRUIT MIGHT JOIN A REGIMENT MADE UP OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT, THE
REGIMENT ITSELF MIGHT BE STATIONED IN HERZEGOVINA AS WELL AS IN VIENNA
OR GALICIA. THE OFFICERS IN THE HABSBURG ARMIES WERE STILL GERMANS AND
SO WAS THE PREDOMINATING ELEMENT IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF THE CIVIL
SERVICE. ART AND SCIENCE WERE IN GERMAN HANDS. APART FROM THE NEW
ARTISTIC TRASH, WHICH MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY A NEGRO TRIBE,
ALL GENUINE ARTISTIC INSPIRATION CAME FROM THE GERMAN SECTION OF THE
POPULATION. IN MUSIC, ARCHITECTURE, SCULPTURE AND PAINTING, VIENNA
ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED THE ENTIRE DUAL MONARCHY. AND THE SOURCE NEVER
SEEMED TO SHOW SIGNS OF A POSSIBLE EXHAUSTION. FINALLY, IT WAS THE
GERMAN ELEMENT THAT DETERMINED THE CONDUCT OF FOREIGN POLICY, THOUGH A
SMALL NUMBER OF HUNGARIANS WERE ALSO ACTIVE IN THAT FIELD.

ALL EFFORTS, HOWEVER, TO SAVE THE UNITY OF THE STATE WERE DOOMED TO END
IN FAILURE, BECAUSE THE ESSENTIAL PRE-REQUISITES WERE MISSING.

THERE WAS ONLY ONE POSSIBLE WAY TO CONTROL AND HOLD IN CHECK THE
CENTRIFUGAL FORCES OF THE DIFFERENT AND DIFFERING NATIONALITIES. THIS
WAY WAS: TO GOVERN THE AUSTRIAN STATE AND ORGANIZE IT INTERNALLY ON THE
PRINCIPLE OF CENTRALIZATION. IN NO OTHER WAY IMAGINABLE COULD THE
EXISTENCE OF THAT STATE BE ASSURED.

NOW AND AGAIN THERE WERE LUCID INTERVALS IN THE HIGHER RULING QUARTERS
WHEN THIS TRUTH WAS RECOGNIZED. BUT IT WAS SOON FORGOTTEN AGAIN, OR ELSE
DELIBERATELY IGNORED, BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES TO BE OVERCOME IN
PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE. EVERY PROJECT WHICH AIMED AT GIVING THE EMPIRE
A MORE FEDERAL SHAPE WAS BOUND TO BE INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO
STRONG CENTRAL AUTHORITY WHICH COULD EXERCISE SUFFICIENT POWER WITHIN
THE STATE TO HOLD THE FEDERAL ELEMENTS TOGETHER. IT MUST BE REMEMBERED
IN THIS CONNECTION THAT CONDITIONS IN AUSTRIA WERE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM
THOSE WHICH CHARACTERIZED THE GERMAN STATE AS FOUNDED BY BISMARCK.
GERMANY WAS FACED WITH ONLY ONE DIFFICULTY, WHICH WAS THAT OF
TRANSFORMING THE PURELY POLITICAL TRADITIONS, BECAUSE THROUGHOUT THE
WHOLE OF BISMARCK'S GERMANY THERE WAS A COMMON CULTURAL BASIS. THE
GERMAN EMPIRE CONTAINED ONLY MEMBERS OF ONE AND THE SAME RACIAL OR
NATIONAL STOCK, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW MINOR FOREIGN FRAGMENTS.

DEMOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS IN AUSTRIA WERE QUITE THE REVERSE. WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF HUNGARY THERE WAS NO POLITICAL TRADITION, COMING DOWN FROM
A GREAT PAST, IN ANY OF THE VARIOUS AFFILIATED COUNTRIES. IF THERE HAD
BEEN, TIME HAD EITHER WIPED OUT ALL TRACES OF IT, OR AT LEAST, RENDERED
THEM OBSCURE. MOREOVER, THIS WAS THE EPOCH WHEN THE PRINCIPLE OF
NATIONALITY BEGAN TO BE IN ASCENDANT; AND THAT PHENOMENON AWAKENED THE
NATIONAL INSTINCTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES AFFILIATED UNDER THE
HABSBURG SCEPTRE. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THE ACTION OF THESE NEWLY
AWAKENED NATIONAL FORCES; BECAUSE, ADJACENT TO THE FRONTIERS OF THE DUAL
MONARCHY, NEW NATIONAL STATES WERE SPRINGING UP WHOSE PEOPLE WERE OF THE
SAME OR KINDRED RACIAL STOCK AS THE RESPECTIVE NATIONALITIES THAT
CONSTITUTED THE HABSBURG EMPIRE. THESE NEW STATES WERE ABLE TO EXERCISE
A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN THE GERMAN ELEMENT.

EVEN VIENNA COULD NOT HOLD OUT FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD IN THIS CONFLICT.
WHEN BUDAPEST HAD DEVELOPED INTO A METROPOLIS A RIVAL HAD GROWN UP WHOSE
MISSION WAS, NOT TO HELP IN HOLDING TOGETHER THE VARIOUS DIVERGENT PARTS
OF THE EMPIRE, BUT RATHER TO STRENGTHEN ONE PART. WITHIN A SHORT TIME
PRAGUE FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE OF BUDAPEST; AND LATER ON CAME LEMBERG,
LAIBACH AND OTHERS. BY RAISING THESE PLACES WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN
PROVINCIAL TOWNS TO THE RANK OF NATIONAL CITIES, RALLYING CENTRES WERE
PROVIDED FOR AN INDEPENDENT CULTURAL LIFE. THROUGH THIS THE LOCAL
NATIONAL INSTINCTS ACQUIRED A SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION AND THEREWITH GAINED
A MORE PROFOUND HOLD ON THE PEOPLE. THE TIME WAS BOUND TO COME WHEN THE
PARTICULARIST INTERESTS OF THOSE VARIOUS COUNTRIES WOULD BECOME STRONGER
THAN THEIR COMMON IMPERIAL INTERESTS. ONCE THAT STAGE HAD BEEN REACHED,
AUSTRIA'S DOOM WAS SEALED.

THE COURSE OF THIS DEVELOPMENT WAS CLEARLY PERCEPTIBLE SINCE THE DEATH
OF JOSEPH II. ITS RAPIDITY DEPENDED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, SOME OF
WHICH HAD THEIR SOURCE IN THE MONARCHY ITSELF; WHILE OTHERS RESULTED
FROM THE POSITION WHICH THE EMPIRE HAD TAKEN IN FOREIGN POLITICS.

IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE ANYTHING LIKE A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT FOR THE
PERMANENT CONSOLIDATION OF THE AUSTRIAN STATE UNLESS A FIRM AND
PERSISTENT POLICY OF CENTRALIZATION WERE PUT INTO FORCE. BEFORE
EVERYTHING ELSE THE PRINCIPLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADOPTED THAT ONLY ONE
COMMON LANGUAGE COULD BE USED AS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF THE STATE.
THUS IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO EMPHASIZE THE FORMAL UNITY OF THAT IMPERIAL
COMMONWEALTH. AND THUS THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD HAVE IN ITS HANDS A
TECHNICAL INSTRUMENT WITHOUT WHICH THE STATE COULD NOT ENDURE AS A
POLITICAL UNITY. IN THE SAME WAY THE SCHOOL AND OTHER FORMS OF EDUCATION
SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO INCULCATE A FEELING OF COMMON CITIZENSHIP. SUCH
AN OBJECTIVE COULD NOT BE REACHED WITHIN TEN OR TWENTY YEARS. THE EFFORT
WOULD HAVE TO BE ENVISAGED IN TERMS OF CENTURIES; JUST AS IN ALL
PROBLEMS OF COLONIZATION, STEADY PERSEVERANCE IS A FAR MORE IMPORTANT
ELEMENT THAN THE OUTPUT OF ENERGETIC EFFORT AT THE MOMENT.

IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE COUNTRY MUST BE
GOVERNED AND ADMINISTERED BY STRICTLY ADHERING TO THE PRINCIPLE OF
UNIFORMITY.

FOR ME IT WAS QUITE INSTRUCTIVE TO DISCOVER WHY THIS DID NOT TAKE PLACE,
OR RATHER WHY IT WAS NOT DONE. THOSE WHO WERE GUILTY OF THE OMISSION
MUST BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BREAK-UP OF THE HABSBURG EMPIRE.

MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE, THE EXISTENCE OF THE OLD AUSTRIA DEPENDED ON
A STRONG AND CAPABLE GOVERNMENT. THE HABSBURG EMPIRE LACKED ETHNICAL
UNIFORMITY, WHICH CONSTITUTES THE FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF A NATIONAL STATE
AND WILL PRESERVE THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A STATE EVEN THOUGH THE RULING
POWER SHOULD BE GROSSLY INEFFICIENT. WHEN A STATE IS COMPOSED OF A
HOMOGENEOUS POPULATION, THE NATURAL INERTIA OF SUCH A POPULATION WILL
HOLD THE STAGE TOGETHER AND MAINTAIN ITS EXISTENCE THROUGH ASTONISHINGLY
LONG PERIODS OF MISGOVERNMENT AND MALADMINISTRATION. IT MAY OFTEN SEEM
AS IF THE PRINCIPLE OF LIFE HAD DIED OUT IN SUCH A BODY-POLITIC; BUT A
TIME COMES WHEN THE APPARENT CORPSE RISES UP AND DISPLAYS BEFORE THE
WORLD AN ASTONISHING MANIFESTATION OF ITS INDESTRUCTIBLE VITALITY.

BUT THE SITUATION IS UTTERLY DIFFERENT IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE POPULATION
IS NOT HOMOGENEOUS, WHERE THERE IS NO BOND OF COMMON BLOOD BUT ONLY THAT
OF ONE RULING HAND. SHOULD THE RULING HAND SHOW SIGNS OF WEAKNESS IN
SUCH A STATE THE RESULT WILL NOT BE TO CAUSE A KIND OF HIBERNATION OF
THE STATE BUT RATHER TO AWAKEN THE INDIVIDUALIST INSTINCTS WHICH ARE
SLUMBERING IN THE ETHNOLOGICAL GROUPS. THESE INSTINCTS DO NOT MAKE
THEMSELVES FELT AS LONG AS THESE GROUPS ARE DOMINATED BY A STRONG
CENTRAL WILL-TO-GOVERN. THE DANGER WHICH EXISTS IN THESE SLUMBERING
SEPARATIST INSTINCTS CAN BE RENDERED MORE OR LESS INNOCUOUS ONLY THROUGH
CENTURIES OF COMMON EDUCATION, COMMON TRADITIONS AND COMMON INTERESTS.
THE YOUNGER SUCH STATES ARE, THE MORE THEIR EXISTENCE WILL DEPEND ON THE
ABILITY AND STRENGTH OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. IF THEIR FOUNDATION WAS
DUE ONLY TO THE WORK OF A STRONG PERSONALITY OR A LEADER WHO IS A MAN OF
GENIUS, IN MANY CASES THEY WILL BREAK UP AS SOON AS THE FOUNDER
DISAPPEARS; BECAUSE, THOUGH GREAT, HE STOOD ALONE. BUT EVEN AFTER
CENTURIES OF A COMMON EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCES THESE SEPARATIST
INSTINCTS I HAVE SPOKEN OF ARE NOT ALWAYS COMPLETELY OVERCOME. THEY MAY
BE ONLY DORMANT AND MAY SUDDENLY AWAKEN WHEN THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
SHOWS WEAKNESS AND THE FORCE OF A COMMON EDUCATION AS WELL AS THE
PRESTIGE OF A COMMON TRADITION PROVE UNABLE TO WITHSTAND THE VITAL
ENERGIES OF SEPARATIST NATIONALITIES FORGING AHEAD TOWARDS THE SHAPING
OF THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL EXISTENCE.

THE FAILURE TO SEE THE TRUTH OF ALL THIS CONSTITUTED WHAT MAY BE CALLED
THE TRAGIC CRIME OF THE HABSBURG RULERS.

ONLY BEFORE THE EYES OF ONE HABSBURG RULER, AND THAT FOR THE LAST TIME,
DID THE HAND OF DESTINY HOLD ALOFT THE TORCH THAT THREW LIGHT ON THE
FUTURE OF HIS COUNTRY. BUT THE TORCH WAS THEN EXTINGUISHED FOR EVER.

JOSEPH II, ROMAN EMPEROR OF THE GERMAN NATION, WAS FILLED WITH A GROWING
ANXIETY WHEN HE REALIZED THE FACT THAT HIS HOUSE WAS REMOVED TO AN
OUTLYING FRONTIER OF HIS EMPIRE AND THAT THE TIME WOULD SOON BE AT HAND
WHEN IT WOULD BE OVERTURNED AND ENGULFED IN THE WHIRLPOOL CAUSED BY THAT
BABYLON OF NATIONALITIES, UNLESS SOMETHING WAS DONE AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR
TO OVERCOME THE DIRE CONSEQUENCES RESULTING FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OF HIS
ANCESTORS. WITH SUPERHUMAN ENERGY THIS 'FRIEND OF MANKIND' MADE EVERY
POSSIBLE EFFORT TO COUNTERACT THE EFFECTS OF THE CARELESSNESS AND
THOUGHTLESSNESS OF HIS PREDECESSORS. WITHIN ONE DECADE HE STROVE TO
REPAIR THE DAMAGE THAT HAD BEEN DONE THROUGH CENTURIES. IF DESTINY HAD
ONLY GRANTED HIM FORTY YEARS FOR HIS LABOURS, AND IF ONLY TWO
GENERATIONS HAD CARRIED ON THE WORK WHICH HE HAD STARTED, THE MIRACLE
MIGHT HAVE BEEN PERFORMED. BUT WHEN HE DIED, BROKEN IN BODY AND SPIRIT
AFTER TEN YEARS OF RULERSHIP, HIS WORK SANK WITH HIM INTO THE GRAVE AND
RESTS WITH HIM THERE IN THE CAPUCIN CRYPT, SLEEPING ITS ETERNAL SLEEP,
HAVING NEVER AGAIN SHOWED SIGNS OF AWAKENING.

HIS SUCCESSORS HAD NEITHER THE ABILITY NOR THE WILL-POWER NECESSARY FOR
THE TASK THEY HAD TO FACE.

WHEN THE FIRST SIGNS OF A NEW REVOLUTIONARY EPOCH APPEARED IN EUROPE
THEY GRADUALLY SCATTERED THE FIRE THROUGHOUT AUSTRIA. AND WHEN THE FIRE
BEGAN TO GLOW STEADILY IT WAS FED AND FANNED NOT BY THE SOCIAL OR
POLITICAL CONDITIONS BUT BY FORCES THAT HAD THEIR ORIGIN IN THE
NATIONALIST YEARNINGS OF THE VARIOUS ETHNIC GROUPS.

THE EUROPEAN REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT OF 1848 PRIMARILY TOOK THE FORM OF A
CLASS CONFLICT IN ALMOST EVERY OTHER COUNTRY, BUT IN AUSTRIA IT TOOK THE
FORM OF A NEW RACIAL STRUGGLE. IN SO FAR AS THE GERMAN-AUSTRIANS THERE
FORGOT THE ORIGINS OF THE MOVEMENT, OR PERHAPS HAD FAILED TO RECOGNIZE
THEM AT THE START AND CONSEQUENTLY TOOK PART IN THE REVOLUTIONARY
UPRISING, THEY SEALED THEIR OWN FATE. FOR THEY THUS HELPED TO AWAKEN THE
SPIRIT OF WESTERN DEMOCRACY WHICH, WITHIN A SHORT WHILE, SHATTERED THE
FOUNDATIONS OF THEIR OWN EXISTENCE.

THE SETTING UP OF A REPRESENTATIVE PARLIAMENTARY BODY, WITHOUT INSISTING
ON THE PRELIMINARY THAT ONLY ONE LANGUAGE SHOULD BE USED IN ALL PUBLIC
INTERCOURSE UNDER THE STATE, WAS THE FIRST GREAT BLOW TO THE
PREDOMINANCE OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT IN THE DUAL MONARCHY. FROM THAT
MOMENT THE STATE WAS ALSO DOOMED TO COLLAPSE SOONER OR LATER. ALL THAT
FOLLOWED WAS NOTHING BUT THE HISTORICAL LIQUIDATION OF AN EMPIRE.

TO WATCH THAT PROCESS OF PROGRESSIVE DISINTEGRATION WAS A TRAGIC AND AT
THE SAME TIME AN INSTRUCTIVE EXPERIENCE. THE EXECUTION OF HISTORY'S
DECREE WAS CARRIED OUT IN THOUSANDS OF DETAILS. THE FACT THAT GREAT
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WENT ABOUT BLINDFOLDED AMID THE MANIFEST SIGNS OF
DISSOLUTION ONLY PROVES THAT THE GODS HAD DECREED THE DESTRUCTION OF
AUSTRIA.

I DO NOT WISH TO DWELL ON DETAILS BECAUSE THAT WOULD LIE OUTSIDE THE
SCOPE OF THIS BOOK. I WANT TO TREAT IN DETAIL ONLY THOSE EVENTS WHICH
ARE TYPICAL AMONG THE CAUSES THAT LEAD TO THE DECLINE OF NATIONS AND
STATES AND WHICH ARE THEREFORE OF IMPORTANCE TO OUR PRESENT AGE.
MOREOVER, THE STUDY OF THESE EVENTS HELPED TO FURNISH THE BASIS OF MY
OWN POLITICAL OUTLOOK.

AMONG THE INSTITUTIONS WHICH MOST CLEARLY MANIFESTED UNMISTAKABLE SIGNS
OF DECAY, EVEN TO THE WEAK-SIGHTED PHILISTINE, WAS THAT WHICH, OF ALL
THE INSTITUTIONS OF STATE, OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE MOST FIRMLY FOUNDED--I
MEAN THE PARLIAMENT, OR THE REICHSRAT (IMPERIAL COUNCIL) AS IT WAS
CALLED IN AUSTRIA.

THE PATTERN FOR THIS CORPORATE BODY WAS OBVIOUSLY THAT WHICH EXISTED IN
ENGLAND, THE LAND OF CLASSIC DEMOCRACY. THE WHOLE OF THAT EXCELLENT
ORGANIZATION WAS BODILY TRANSFERRED TO AUSTRIA WITH AS LITTLE ALTERATION
AS POSSIBLE.

AS THE AUSTRIAN COUNTERPART TO THE BRITISH TWO-CHAMBER SYSTEM A CHAMBER
OF DEPUTIES AND A HOUSE OF LORDS (HERRENHAUS) WERE ESTABLISHED IN
VIENNA. THE HOUSES THEMSELVES, CONSIDERED AS BUILDINGS WERE SOMEWHAT
DIFFERENT. WHEN BARRY BUILT HIS PALACES, OR, AS WE SAY THE HOUSES OF
PARLIAMENT, ON THE SHORE OF THE THAMES, HE COULD LOOK TO THE HISTORY OF
THE BRITISH EMPIRE FOR THE INSPIRATION OF HIS WORK. IN THAT HISTORY HE
FOUND SUFFICIENT MATERIAL TO FILL AND DECORATE THE 1,200 NICHES,
BRACKETS, AND PILLARS OF HIS MAGNIFICENT EDIFICE. HIS STATUES AND
PAINTINGS MADE THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TEMPLES
DEDICATED TO THE GLORY OF THE NATION.

THERE IT WAS THAT VIENNA ENCOUNTERED THE FIRST DIFFICULTY. WHEN HANSEN,
THE DANISH ARCHITECT, HAD COMPLETED THE LAST GABLE OF THE MARBLE PALACE
IN WHICH THE NEW BODY OF POPULAR REPRESENTATIVES WAS TO BE HOUSED HE HAD
TO TURN TO THE ANCIENT CLASSICAL WORLD FOR SUBJECTS TO FILL OUT HIS
DECORATIVE PLAN. THIS THEATRICAL SHRINE OF 'WESTERN DEMOCRACY' WAS
ADORNED WITH THE STATUES AND PORTRAITS OF GREEK AND ROMAN STATESMEN AND
PHILOSOPHERS. AS IF IT WERE MEANT FOR A SYMBOL OF IRONY, THE HORSES OF
THE QUADRIGA THAT SURMOUNTS THE TWO HOUSES ARE PULLING APART FROM ONE
ANOTHER TOWARDS ALL FOUR QUARTERS OF THE GLOBE. THERE COULD BE NO BETTER
SYMBOL FOR THE KIND OF ACTIVITY GOING ON WITHIN THE WALLS OF THAT SAME
BUILDING.

THE 'NATIONALITIES' WERE OPPOSED TO ANY KIND OF GLORIFICATION OF
AUSTRIAN HISTORY IN THE DECORATION OF THIS BUILDING, INSISTING THAT SUCH
WOULD CONSTITUTE AN OFFENCE TO THEM AND A PROVOCATION. MUCH THE SAME
HAPPENED IN GERMANY, WHERE THE REICH-STAG, BUILT BY WALLOT, WAS NOT
DEDICATED TO THE GERMAN PEOPLE UNTIL THE CANNONS WERE THUNDERING IN THE
WORLD WAR. AND THEN IT WAS DEDICATED BY AN INSCRIPTION.

I WAS NOT YET TWENTY YEARS OF AGE WHEN I FIRST ENTERED THE PALACE ON THE
FRANZENS-RING TO WATCH AND LISTEN IN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES. THAT FIRST
EXPERIENCE AROUSED IN ME A PROFOUND FEELING OF REPUGNANCE.

I HAD ALWAYS HATED THE PARLIAMENT, BUT NOT AS AN INSTITUTION IN ITSELF.
QUITE THE CONTRARY. AS ONE WHO CHERISHED IDEALS OF POLITICAL FREEDOM I
COULD NOT EVEN IMAGINE ANY OTHER FORM OF GOVERNMENT. IN THE LIGHT OF MY
ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG I SHOULD THEN HAVE CONSIDERED IT
A CRIME AGAINST LIBERTY AND REASON TO THINK OF ANY KIND OF DICTATORSHIP
AS A POSSIBLE FORM OF GOVERNMENT.

A CERTAIN ADMIRATION WHICH I HAD FOR THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT CONTRIBUTED
TOWARDS THE FORMATION OF THIS OPINION. I BECAME IMBUED WITH THAT FEELING
OF ADMIRATION ALMOST WITHOUT MY BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE EFFECT OF IT
THROUGH SO MUCH READING OF NEWSPAPERS WHILE I WAS YET QUITE YOUNG. I
COULD NOT DISCARD THAT ADMIRATION ALL IN A MOMENT. THE DIGNIFIED WAY IN
WHICH THE BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS FULFILLED ITS FUNCTION IMPRESSED ME
GREATLY, THANKS LARGELY TO THE GLOWING TERMS IN WHICH THE AUSTRIAN PRESS
REPORTED THESE EVENTS. I USED TO ASK MYSELF WHETHER THERE COULD BE ANY
NOBLER FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAN SELF-GOVERNMENT BY THE PEOPLE.

BUT THESE CONSIDERATIONS FURNISHED THE VERY MOTIVES OF MY HOSTILITY TO
THE AUSTRIAN PARLIAMENT. THE FORM IN WHICH PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT WAS
HERE REPRESENTED SEEMED UNWORTHY OF ITS GREAT PROTOTYPE. THE FOLLOWING
CONSIDERATIONS ALSO INFLUENCED MY ATTITUDE:

THE FATE OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT IN THE AUSTRIAN STATE DEPENDED ON ITS
POSITION IN PARLIAMENT. UP TO THE TIME THAT UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE BY SECRET
BALLOT WAS INTRODUCED THE GERMAN REPRESENTATIVES HAD A MAJORITY IN THE
PARLIAMENT, THOUGH THAT MAJORITY WAS NOT A VERY SUBSTANTIAL ONE. THIS
SITUATION GAVE CAUSE FOR ANXIETY BECAUSE THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC FRACTION
OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT COULD NOT BE RELIED UPON WHEN NATIONAL QUESTIONS
WERE AT STAKE. IN MATTERS THAT WERE OF CRITICAL CONCERN FOR THE GERMAN
ELEMENT, THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS ALWAYS TOOK UP AN ANTI-GERMAN STAND
BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF LOSING THEIR FOLLOWERS AMONG THE OTHER
NATIONAL GROUPS. ALREADY AT THAT TIME--BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF
UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE--THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC PARTY COULD NO LONGER BE
CONSIDERED AS A GERMAN PARTY. THE INTRODUCTION OF UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE PUT
AN END EVEN TO THE PURELY NUMERICAL PREDOMINANCE OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT.
THE WAY WAS NOW CLEAR FOR THE FURTHER 'DE-GERMANIZATION' OF THE AUSTRIAN
STATE.

THE NATIONAL INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO
WELCOME A REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM IN WHICH THE GERMAN ELEMENT WAS NOT
REALLY REPRESENTED AS SUCH, BUT ALWAYS BETRAYED BY THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC
FRACTION. YET ALL THESE, AND MANY OTHERS, WERE DEFECTS WHICH COULD NOT
BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM AS SUCH, BUT RATHER TO THE
AUSTRIAN STATE IN PARTICULAR. I STILL BELIEVED THAT IF THE GERMAN
MAJORITY COULD BE RESTORED IN THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY THERE WOULD BE NO
OCCASION TO OPPOSE SUCH A SYSTEM AS LONG AS THE OLD AUSTRIAN STATE
CONTINUED TO EXIST.

SUCH WAS MY GENERAL ATTITUDE AT THE TIME WHEN I FIRST ENTERED THOSE
SACRED AND CONTENTIOUS HALLS. FOR ME THEY WERE SACRED ONLY BECAUSE OF
THE RADIANT BEAUTY OF THAT MAJESTIC EDIFICE. A GREEK WONDER ON GERMAN
SOIL.

BUT I SOON BECAME ENRAGED BY THE HIDEOUS SPECTACLE THAT MET MY EYES.
SEVERAL HUNDRED REPRESENTATIVES WERE THERE TO DISCUSS A PROBLEM OF GREAT
ECONOMICAL IMPORTANCE AND EACH REPRESENTATIVE HAD THE RIGHT TO HAVE HIS
SAY.

THAT EXPERIENCE OF A DAY WAS ENOUGH TO SUPPLY ME WITH FOOD FOR THOUGHT
DURING SEVERAL WEEKS AFTERWARDS.

THE INTELLECTUAL LEVEL OF THE DEBATE WAS QUITE LOW. SOME TIMES THE
DEBATERS DID NOT MAKE THEMSELVES INTELLIGIBLE AT ALL. SEVERAL OF THOSE
PRESENT DID NOT SPEAK GERMAN BUT ONLY THEIR SLAV VERNACULARS OR
DIALECTS. THUS I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HEARING WITH MY OWN EARS WHAT I
HAD BEEN HITHERTO ACQUAINTED WITH ONLY THROUGH READING THE NEWSPAPERS. A
TURBULENT MASS OF PEOPLE, ALL GESTICULATING AND BAWLING AGAINST ONE
ANOTHER, WITH A PATHETIC OLD MAN SHAKING HIS BELL AND MAKING FRANTIC
EFFORTS TO CALL THE HOUSE TO A SENSE OF ITS DIGNITY BY FRIENDLY APPEALS,
EXHORTATIONS, AND GRAVE WARNINGS.

I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM LAUGHING.

SEVERAL WEEKS LATER I PAID A SECOND VISIT. THIS TIME THE HOUSE PRESENTED
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PICTURE, SO MUCH SO THAT ONE COULD HARDLY
RECOGNIZE IT AS THE SAME PLACE. THE HALL WAS PRACTICALLY EMPTY. THEY
WERE SLEEPING IN THE OTHER ROOMS BELOW. ONLY A FEW DEPUTIES WERE IN
THEIR PLACES, YAWNING IN EACH OTHER'S FACES. ONE WAS SPEECHIFYING. A
DEPUTY SPEAKER WAS IN THE CHAIR. WHEN HE LOOKED ROUND IT WAS QUITE PLAIN
THAT HE FELT BORED.

THEN I BEGAN TO REFLECT SERIOUSLY ON THE WHOLE THING. I WENT TO THE
PARLIAMENT WHENEVER I HAD ANY TIME TO SPARE AND WATCHED THE SPECTACLE
SILENTLY BUT ATTENTIVELY. I LISTENED TO THE DEBATES, AS FAR AS THEY
COULD BE UNDERSTOOD, AND I STUDIED THE MORE OR LESS INTELLIGENT FEATURES
OF THOSE 'ELECT' REPRESENTATIVES OF THE VARIOUS NATIONALITIES WHICH
COMPOSED THAT MOTLEY STATE. GRADUALLY I FORMED MY OWN IDEAS ABOUT WHAT I
SAW.

A YEAR OF SUCH QUIET OBSERVATION WAS SUFFICIENT TO TRANSFORM OR
COMPLETELY DESTROY MY FORMER CONVICTIONS AS TO THE CHARACTER OF THIS
PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTION. I NO LONGER OPPOSED MERELY THE PERVERTED FORM
WHICH THE PRINCIPLE OF PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION HAD ASSUMED IN
AUSTRIA. NO. IT HAD BECOME IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO ACCEPT THE SYSTEM IN
ITSELF. UP TO THAT TIME I HAD BELIEVED THAT THE DISASTROUS DEFICIENCIES
OF THE AUSTRIAN PARLIAMENT WERE DUE TO THE LACK OF A GERMAN MAJORITY,
BUT NOW I RECOGNIZED THAT THE INSTITUTION ITSELF WAS WRONG IN ITS VERY
ESSENCE AND FORM.

A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS PRESENTED THEMSELVES BEFORE MY MIND. I STUDIED MORE
CLOSELY THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE OF 'DECISION BY THE MAJORITY VOTE', AND
I SCRUTINIZED NO LESS CAREFULLY THE INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL WORTH OF THE
GENTLEMEN WHO, AS THE CHOSEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION, WERE
ENTRUSTED WITH THE TASK OF MAKING THIS INSTITUTION FUNCTION.

THUS IT HAPPENED THAT AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME I CAME TO KNOW THE
INSTITUTION ITSELF AND THOSE OF WHOM IT WAS COMPOSED. AND IT WAS THUS
THAT, WITHIN THE COURSE OF A FEW YEARS, I CAME TO FORM A CLEAR AND VIVID
PICTURE OF THE AVERAGE TYPE OF THAT MOST LIGHTLY WORSHIPPED PHENOMENON
OF OUR TIME--THE PARLIAMENTARY DEPUTY. THE PICTURE OF HIM WHICH I THEN
FORMED BECAME DEEPLY ENGRAVED ON MY MIND AND I HAVE NEVER ALTERED IT
SINCE, AT LEAST AS FAR AS ESSENTIALS GO.

ONCE AGAIN THESE OBJECT-LESSONS TAKEN FROM REAL LIFE SAVED ME FROM
GETTING FIRMLY ENTANGLED BY A THEORY WHICH AT FIRST SIGHT SEEMS SO
ALLURING TO MANY PEOPLE, THOUGH THAT THEORY ITSELF IS A SYMPTOM OF HUMAN
DECADENCE.

DEMOCRACY, AS PRACTISED IN WESTERN EUROPE TO-DAY, IS THE FORE-RUNNER OF
MARXISM. IN FACT, THE LATTER WOULD NOT BE CONCEIVABLE WITHOUT THE
FORMER. DEMOCRACY IS THE BREEDING-GROUND IN WHICH THE BACILLI OF THE
MARXIST WORLD PEST CAN GROW AND SPREAD. BY THE INTRODUCTION OF
PARLIAMENTARIANISM, DEMOCRACY PRODUCED AN ABORTION OF FILTH AND FIRE
(NOTE 6), THE CREATIVE FIRE OF WHICH, HOWEVER, SEEMS TO HAVE DIED OUT.

[NOTE 6. SPOTTGEBURT VON DRECK UND FEUER. THIS IS THE EPITHET THAT FAUST
HURLS AT MEPHISTOPHELES AS THE LATTER INTRUDES ON THE CONVERSATION
BETWEEN FAUST AND MARTHA IN THE GARDEN:

MEPHISTOPHELES: THOU, FULL OF SENSUAL, SUPER-SENSUAL DESIRE,
                A GIRL BY THE NOSE IS LEADING THEE.
FAUST: ABORTION, THOU OF FILTH AND FIRE.]

I AM MORE THAN GRATEFUL TO FATE THAT THIS PROBLEM CAME TO MY NOTICE WHEN
I WAS STILL IN VIENNA; FOR IF I HAD BEEN IN GERMANY AT THAT TIME I MIGHT
EASILY HAVE FOUND ONLY A SUPERFICIAL SOLUTION. IF I HAD BEEN IN BERLIN
WHEN I FIRST DISCOVERED WHAT AN ILLOGICAL THING THIS INSTITUTION IS
WHICH WE CALL PARLIAMENT, I MIGHT EASILY HAVE GONE TO THE OTHER EXTREME
AND BELIEVED--AS MANY PEOPLE BELIEVED, AND APPARENTLY NOT WITHOUT GOOD
REASON--THAT THE SALVATION OF THE PEOPLE AND THE EMPIRE COULD BE SECURED
ONLY BY RESTRENGTHENING THE PRINCIPLE OF IMPERIAL AUTHORITY. THOSE WHO
HAD THIS BELIEF DID NOT DISCERN THE TENDENCIES OF THEIR TIME AND WERE
BLIND TO THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE PEOPLE.

IN AUSTRIA ONE COULD NOT BE SO EASILY MISLED. THERE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO
FALL FROM ONE ERROR INTO ANOTHER. IF THE PARLIAMENT WERE WORTHLESS, THE
HABSBURGS WERE WORSE; OR AT LEAST NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE BETTER.
THE PROBLEM WAS NOT SOLVED BY REJECTING THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM.
IMMEDIATELY THE QUESTION AROSE: WHAT THEN? TO REPUDIATE AND ABOLISH THE
VIENNA PARLIAMENT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN LEAVING ALL POWER IN THE HANDS
OF THE HABSBURGS. FOR ME, ESPECIALLY, THAT IDEA WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

SINCE THIS PROBLEM WAS SPECIALLY DIFFICULT IN REGARD TO AUSTRIA, I WAS
FORCED WHILE STILL QUITE YOUNG TO GO INTO THE ESSENTIALS OF THE WHOLE
QUESTION MORE THOROUGHLY THAN I OTHERWISE SHOULD HAVE DONE.

THE ASPECT OF THE SITUATION THAT FIRST MADE THE MOST STRIKING IMPRESSION
ON ME AND GAVE ME GROUNDS FOR SERIOUS REFLECTION WAS THE MANIFEST LACK
OF ANY INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY.

THE PARLIAMENT PASSES SOME ACTS OR DECREE WHICH MAY HAVE THE MOST
DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES, YET NOBODY BEARS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.
NOBODY CAN BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT. FOR SURELY ONE CANNOT SAY THAT A
CABINET DISCHARGES ITS RESPONSIBILITY WHEN IT RETIRES AFTER HAVING
BROUGHT ABOUT A CATASTROPHE. OR CAN WE SAY THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY IS
FULLY DISCHARGED WHEN A NEW COALITION IS FORMED OR PARLIAMENT DISSOLVED?
CAN THE PRINCIPLE OF RESPONSIBILITY MEAN ANYTHING ELSE THAN THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF A DEFINITE PERSON?

IS IT AT ALL POSSIBLE ACTUALLY TO CALL TO ACCOUNT THE LEADERS OF A
PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT FOR ANY KIND OF ACTION WHICH ORIGINATED IN THE
WISHES OF THE WHOLE MULTITUDE OF DEPUTIES AND WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER
THEIR ORDERS OR SANCTION? INSTEAD OF DEVELOPING CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS AND
PLANS, DOES THE BUSINESS OF A STATESMAN CONSIST IN THE ART OF MAKING A
WHOLE PACK OF BLOCKHEADS UNDERSTAND HIS PROJECTS? IS IT HIS BUSINESS TO
ENTREAT AND COACH THEM SO THAT THEY WILL GRANT HIM THEIR GENEROUS
CONSENT?

IS IT AN INDISPENSABLE QUALITY IN A STATESMAN THAT HE SHOULD POSSESS A
GIFT OF PERSUASION COMMENSURATE WITH THE STATESMAN'S ABILITY TO CONCEIVE
GREAT POLITICAL MEASURES AND CARRY THEM THROUGH INTO PRACTICE?

DOES IT REALLY PROVE THAT A STATESMAN IS INCOMPETENT IF HE SHOULD FAIL
TO WIN OVER A MAJORITY OF VOTES TO SUPPORT HIS POLICY IN AN ASSEMBLY
WHICH HAS BEEN CALLED TOGETHER AS THE CHANCE RESULT OF AN ELECTORAL
SYSTEM THAT IS NOT ALWAYS HONESTLY ADMINISTERED.

HAS THERE EVER BEEN A CASE WHERE SUCH AN ASSEMBLY HAS WORTHILY APPRAISED
A GREAT POLITICAL CONCEPT BEFORE THAT CONCEPT WAS PUT INTO PRACTICE AND
ITS GREATNESS OPENLY DEMONSTRATED THROUGH ITS SUCCESS?

IN THIS WORLD IS NOT THE CREATIVE ACT OF THE GENIUS ALWAYS A PROTEST
AGAINST THE INERTIA OF THE MASS?

WHAT SHALL THE STATESMAN DO IF HE DOES NOT SUCCEED IN COAXING THE
PARLIAMENTARY MULTITUDE TO GIVE ITS CONSENT TO HIS POLICY? SHALL HE
PURCHASE THAT CONSENT FOR SOME SORT OF CONSIDERATION?

OR, WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THE OBSTINATE STUPIDITY OF HIS FELLOW CITIZENS,
SHOULD HE THEN REFRAIN FROM PUSHING FORWARD THE MEASURES WHICH HE DEEMS
TO BE OF VITAL NECESSITY TO THE LIFE OF THE NATION? SHOULD HE RETIRE OR
REMAIN IN POWER?

IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES DOES NOT A MAN OF CHARACTER FIND HIMSELF FACE TO
FACE WITH AN INSOLUBLE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN HIS OWN POLITICAL INSIGHT
ON THE ONE HAND AND, ON THE OTHER, HIS MORAL INTEGRITY, OR, BETTER
STILL, HIS SENSE OF HONESTY?

WHERE CAN WE DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN PUBLIC DUTY AND PERSONAL HONOUR?

MUST NOT EVERY GENUINE LEADER RENOUNCE THE IDEA OF DEGRADING HIMSELF TO
THE LEVEL OF A POLITICAL JOBBER?

AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, DOES NOT EVERY JOBBER FEEL THE ITCH TO 'PLAY
POLITICS', SEEING THAT THE FINAL RESPONSIBILITY WILL NEVER REST WITH HIM
PERSONALLY BUT WITH AN ANONYMOUS MASS WHICH CAN NEVER BE CALLED TO
ACCOUNT FOR THEIR DEEDS?

MUST NOT OUR PARLIAMENTARY PRINCIPLE OF GOVERNMENT BY NUMERICAL MAJORITY
NECESSARILY LEAD TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEADERSHIP?

DOES ANYBODY HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT HUMAN PROGRESS ORIGINATES IN THE
COMPOSITE BRAIN OF THE MAJORITY AND NOT IN THE BRAIN OF THE INDIVIDUAL
PERSONALITY?

OR MAY IT BE PRESUMED THAT FOR THE FUTURE HUMAN CIVILIZATION WILL BE
ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH THIS AS A CONDITION OF ITS EXISTENCE?

BUT MAY IT NOT BE THAT, TO-DAY, MORE THAN EVER BEFORE, THE CREATIVE
BRAIN OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS INDISPENSABLE?

THE PARLIAMENTARY PRINCIPLE OF VESTING LEGISLATIVE POWER IN THE DECISION
OF THE MAJORITY REJECTS THE AUTHORITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND PUTS A
NUMERICAL QUOTA OF ANONYMOUS HEADS IN ITS PLACE. IN DOING SO IT
CONTRADICTS THE ARISTROCRATIC PRINCIPLE, WHICH IS A FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF
NATURE; BUT, OF COURSE, WE MUST REMEMBER THAT IN THIS DECADENT ERA OF
OURS THE ARISTROCRATIC PRINCIPLE NEED NOT BE THOUGHT OF AS INCORPORATED
IN THE UPPER TEN THOUSAND.

THE DEVASTATING INFLUENCE OF THIS PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTION MIGHT NOT
EASILY BE RECOGNIZED BY THOSE WHO READ THE JEWISH PRESS, UNLESS THE
READER HAS LEARNED HOW TO THINK INDEPENDENTLY AND EXAMINE THE FACTS FOR
HIMSELF. THIS INSTITUTION IS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CROWDED
INRUSH OF MEDIOCRE PEOPLE INTO THE FIELD OF POLITICS. CONFRONTED WITH
SUCH A PHENOMENON, A MAN WHO IS ENDOWED WITH REAL QUALITIES OF
LEADERSHIP WILL BE TEMPTED TO REFRAIN FROM TAKING PART IN POLITICAL
LIFE; BECAUSE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE SITUATION DOES NOT CALL FOR
A MAN WHO HAS A CAPACITY FOR CONSTRUCTIVE STATESMANSHIP BUT RATHER FOR A
MAN WHO IS CAPABLE OF BARGAINING FOR THE FAVOUR OF THE MAJORITY. THUS
THE SITUATION WILL APPEAL TO SMALL MINDS AND WILL ATTRACT THEM
ACCORDINGLY.

THE NARROWER THE MENTAL OUTLOOK AND THE MORE MEAGRE THE AMOUNT OF
KNOWLEDGE IN A POLITICAL JOBBER, THE MORE ACCURATE IS HIS ESTIMATE OF
HIS OWN POLITICAL STOCK, AND THUS HE WILL BE ALL THE MORE INCLINED TO
APPRECIATE A SYSTEM WHICH DOES NOT DEMAND CREATIVE GENIUS OR EVEN
HIGH-CLASS TALENT; BUT RATHER THAT CRAFTY KIND OF SAGACITY WHICH MAKES
AN EFFICIENT TOWN CLERK. INDEED, HE VALUES THIS KIND OF SMALL CRAFTINESS
MORE THAN THE POLITICAL GENIUS OF A PERICLES. SUCH A MEDIOCRITY DOES NOT
EVEN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HE DOES. FROM THE
BEGINNING HE KNOWS THAT WHATEVER BE THE RESULTS OF HIS 'STATESMANSHIP'
HIS END IS ALREADY PRESCRIBED BY THE STARS; HE WILL ONE DAY HAVE TO
CLEAR OUT AND MAKE ROOM FOR ANOTHER WHO IS OF SIMILAR MENTAL CALIBRE.
FOR IT IS ANOTHER SIGN OF OUR DECADENT TIMES THAT THE NUMBER OF EMINENT
STATESMEN GROWS ACCORDING AS THE CALIBRE OF INDIVIDUAL PERSONALITY
DWINDLES. THAT CALIBRE WILL BECOME SMALLER AND SMALLER THE MORE THE
INDIVIDUAL POLITICIAN HAS TO DEPEND UPON PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITIES. A MAN
OF REAL POLITICAL ABILITY WILL REFUSE TO BE THE BEADLE FOR A BEVY OF
FOOTLING CACKLERS; AND THEY IN THEIR TURN, BEING THE REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE MAJORITY--WHICH MEANS THE DUNDER-HEADED MULTITUDE--HATE NOTHING SO
MUCH AS A SUPERIOR BRAIN.

FOR FOOTLING DEPUTIES IT IS ALWAYS QUITE A CONSOLATION TO BE LED BY A
PERSON WHOSE INTELLECTUAL STATURE IS ON A LEVEL WITH THEIR OWN. THUS
EACH ONE MAY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHINE IN DEBATE AMONG SUCH COMPEERS
AND, ABOVE ALL, EACH ONE FEELS THAT HE MAY ONE DAY RISE TO THE TOP. IF
PETER BE BOSS TO-DAY, THEN WHY NOT PAUL TOMORROW?

THIS NEW INVENTION OF DEMOCRACY IS VERY CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH A
PECULIAR PHENOMENON WHICH HAS RECENTLY SPREAD TO A PERNICIOUS EXTENT,
NAMELY THE COWARDICE OF A LARGE SECTION OF OUR SO-CALLED POLITICAL
LEADERS. WHENEVER IMPORTANT DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE THEY ALWAYS FIND
THEMSELVES FORTUNATE IN BEING ABLE TO HIDE BEHIND THE BACKS OF WHAT THEY
CALL THE MAJORITY.

IN OBSERVING ONE OF THESE POLITICAL MANIPULATORS ONE NOTICES HOW HE
WHEEDLES THE MAJORITY IN ORDER TO GET THEIR SANCTION FOR WHATEVER ACTION
HE TAKES. HE HAS TO HAVE ACCOMPLICES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SHIFT
RESPONSIBILITY TO OTHER SHOULDERS WHENEVER IT IS OPPORTUNE TO DO SO.
THAT IS THE MAIN REASON WHY THIS KIND OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY IS ABHORRENT
TO MEN OF CHARACTER AND COURAGE, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME IT ATTRACTS
INFERIOR TYPES; FOR A PERSON WHO IS NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY
FOR HIS OWN ACTIONS, BUT IS ALWAYS SEEKING TO BE COVERED BY SOMETHING,
MUST BE CLASSED AMONG THE KNAVES AND THE RASCALS. IF A NATIONAL LEADER
SHOULD COME FROM THAT LOWER CLASS OF POLITICIANS THE EVIL CONSEQUENCES
WILL SOON MANIFEST THEMSELVES. NOBODY WILL THEN HAVE THE COURAGE TO TAKE
A DECISIVE STEP. THEY WILL SUBMIT TO ABUSE AND DEFAMATION RATHER THAN
PLUCK UP COURAGE TO TAKE A DEFINITE STAND. AND THUS NOBODY IS LEFT WHO
IS WILLING TO RISK HIS POSITION AND HIS CAREER, IF NEEDS BE, IN SUPPORT
OF A DETERMINED LINE OF POLICY.

ONE TRUTH WHICH MUST ALWAYS BE BORNE IN MIND IS THAT THE MAJORITY CAN
NEVER REPLACE THE MAN. THE MAJORITY REPRESENTS NOT ONLY IGNORANCE BUT
ALSO COWARDICE. AND JUST AS A HUNDRED BLOCKHEADS DO NOT EQUAL ONE MAN OF
WISDOM, SO A HUNDRED POLTROONS ARE INCAPABLE OF ANY POLITICAL LINE OF
ACTION THAT REQUIRES MORAL STRENGTH AND FORTITUDE.

THE LIGHTER THE BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY ON EACH INDIVIDUAL LEADER, THE
GREATER WILL BE THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO, IN SPITE OF THEIR SORRY
MEDIOCRITY, WILL FEEL THE CALL TO PLACE THEIR IMMORTAL ENERGIES AT THE
DISPOSAL OF THE NATION. THEY ARE SO MUCH ON THE TIP-TOE OF EXPECTATION
THAT THEY FIND IT HARD TO WAIT THEIR TURN. THEY STAND IN A LONG QUEUE,
PAINFULLY AND SADLY COUNTING THE NUMBER OF THOSE AHEAD OF THEM AND
CALCULATING THE HOURS UNTIL THEY MAY EVENTUALLY COME FORWARD. THEY WATCH
EVERY CHANGE THAT TAKES PLACE IN THE PERSONNEL OF THE OFFICE TOWARDS
WHICH THEIR HOPES ARE DIRECTED, AND THEY ARE GRATEFUL FOR EVERY SCANDAL
WHICH REMOVES ONE OF THE ASPIRANTS WAITING AHEAD OF THEM IN THE QUEUE.
IF SOMEBODY STICKS TOO LONG TO HIS OFFICE STOOL THEY CONSIDER THIS AS
ALMOST A BREACH OF A SACRED UNDERSTANDING BASED ON THEIR MUTUAL
SOLIDARITY. THEY GROW FURIOUS AND GIVE NO PEACE UNTIL THAT INCONSIDERATE
PERSON IS FINALLY DRIVEN OUT AND FORCED TO HAND OVER HIS COSY BERTH FOR
PUBLIC DISPOSAL. AFTER THAT HE WILL HAVE LITTLE CHANCE OF GETTING
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY. USUALLY THOSE PLACEMEN WHO HAVE BEEN FORCED TO GIVE
UP THEIR POSTS PUSH THEMSELVES AGAIN INTO THE WAITING QUEUE UNLESS THEY
ARE HOUNDED AWAY BY THE PROTESTATIONS OF THE OTHER ASPIRANTS.

THE RESULT OF ALL THIS IS THAT, IN SUCH A STATE, THE SUCCESSION OF
SUDDEN CHANGES IN PUBLIC POSITIONS AND PUBLIC OFFICES HAS A VERY
DISQUIETING EFFECT IN GENERAL, WHICH MAY EASILY LEAD TO DISASTER WHEN AN
ADVERSE CRISIS ARISES. IT IS NOT ONLY THE IGNORANT AND THE INCOMPETENT
PERSON WHO MAY FALL VICTIM TO THOSE PARLIAMENTARY CONDITIONS, FOR THE
GENUINE LEADER MAY BE AFFECTED JUST AS MUCH AS THE OTHERS, IF NOT MORE
SO, WHENEVER FATE HAS CHANCED TO PLACE A CAPABLE MAN IN THE POSITION OF
LEADER. LET THE SUPERIOR QUALITY OF SUCH A LEADER BE ONCE RECOGNIZED AND
THE RESULT WILL BE THAT A JOINT FRONT WILL BE ORGANIZED AGAINST HIM,
PARTICULARLY IF THAT LEADER, THOUGH NOT COMING FROM THEIR RANKS, SHOULD
FALL INTO THE HABIT OF INTERMINGLING WITH THESE ILLUSTRIOUS NINCOMPOOPS
ON THEIR OWN LEVEL. THEY WANT TO HAVE ONLY THEIR OWN COMPANY AND WILL
QUICKLY TAKE A HOSTILE ATTITUDE TOWARDS ANY MAN WHO MIGHT SHOW HIMSELF
OBVIOUSLY ABOVE AND BEYOND THEM WHEN HE MINGLES IN THEIR RANKS. THEIR
INSTINCT, WHICH IS SO BLIND IN OTHER DIRECTIONS, IS VERY SHARP IN THIS
PARTICULAR.

THE INEVITABLE RESULT IS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL LEVEL OF THE RULING CLASS
SINKS STEADILY. ONE CAN EASILY FORECAST HOW MUCH THE NATION AND STATE
ARE BOUND TO SUFFER FROM SUCH A CONDITION OF AFFAIRS, PROVIDED ONE DOES
NOT BELONG TO THAT SAME CLASS OF 'LEADERS'.

THE PARLIAMENTARY RÃ©GIME IN THE OLD AUSTRIA WAS THE VERY ARCHETYPE OF
THE INSTITUTION AS I HAVE DESCRIBED IT.

THOUGH THE AUSTRIAN PRIME MINISTER WAS APPOINTED BY THE KING-EMPEROR,
THIS ACT OF APPOINTMENT MERELY GAVE PRACTICAL EFFECT TO THE WILL OF THE
PARLIAMENT. THE HUCKSTERING AND BARGAINING THAT WENT ON IN REGARD TO
EVERY MINISTERIAL POSITION SHOWED ALL THE TYPICAL MARKS OF WESTERN
DEMOCRACY. THE RESULTS THAT FOLLOWED WERE IN KEEPING WITH THE PRINCIPLES
APPLIED. THE INTERVALS BETWEEN THE REPLACEMENT OF ONE PERSON BY ANOTHER
GRADUALLY BECAME SHORTER, FINALLY ENDING UP IN A WILD RELAY CHASE. WITH
EACH CHANGE THE QUALITY OF THE 'STATESMAN' IN QUESTION DETERIORATED,
UNTIL FINALLY ONLY THE PETTY TYPE OF POLITICAL HUCKSTER REMAINED. IN
SUCH PEOPLE THE QUALITIES OF STATESMANSHIP WERE MEASURED AND VALUED
ACCORDING TO THE ADROITNESS WITH WHICH THEY PIECED TOGETHER ONE
COALITION AFTER ANOTHER; IN OTHER WORDS, THEIR CRAFTINESS IN
MANIPULATING THE PETTIEST POLITICAL TRANSACTIONS, WHICH IS THE ONLY KIND
OF PRACTICAL ACTIVITY SUITED TO THE APTITUDES OF THESE REPRESENTATIVES.

IN THIS SPHERE VIENNA WAS THE SCHOOL WHICH OFFERED THE MOST IMPRESSIVE
EXAMPLES.

ANOTHER FEATURE THAT ENGAGED MY ATTENTION QUITE AS MUCH AS THE FEATURES
I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OF WAS THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE TALENTS AND
KNOWLEDGE OF THESE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE ON THE ONE HAND AND, ON
THE OTHER, THE NATURE OF THE TASKS THEY HAD TO FACE. WILLINGLY OR
UNWILLINGLY, ONE COULD NOT HELP THINKING SERIOUSLY OF THE NARROW
INTELLECTUAL OUTLOOK OF THESE CHOSEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE VARIOUS
CONSTITUENT NATIONALITIES, AND ONE COULD NOT AVOID PONDERING ON THE
METHODS THROUGH WHICH THESE NOBLE FIGURES IN OUR PUBLIC LIFE WERE FIRST
DISCOVERED.

IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO MAKE A THOROUGH STUDY AND EXAMINATION OF THE WAY
IN WHICH THE REAL TALENTS OF THESE GENTLEMEN WERE DEVOTED TO THE SERVICE
OF THEIR COUNTRY; IN OTHER WORDS, TO ANALYSE THOROUGHLY THE TECHNICAL
PROCEDURE OF THEIR ACTIVITIES.

THE WHOLE SPECTACLE OF PARLIAMENTARY LIFE BECAME MORE AND MORE DESOLATE
THE MORE ONE PENETRATED INTO ITS INTIMATE STRUCTURE AND STUDIED THE
PERSONS AND PRINCIPLES OF THE SYSTEM IN A SPIRIT OF RUTHLESS
OBJECTIVITY. INDEED, IT IS VERY NECESSARY TO BE STRICTLY OBJECTIVE IN
THE STUDY OF THE INSTITUTION WHOSE SPONSORS TALK OF 'OBJECTIVITY' IN
EVERY OTHER SENTENCE AS THE ONLY FAIR BASIS OF EXAMINATION AND JUDGMENT.
IF ONE STUDIED THESE GENTLEMEN AND THE LAWS OF THEIR STRENUOUS EXISTENCE
THE RESULTS WERE SURPRISING.

THERE IS NO OTHER PRINCIPLE WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE QUITE SO ILL-CONCEIVED
AS THE PARLIAMENTARY PRINCIPLE, IF WE EXAMINE IT OBJECTIVELY.

IN OUR EXAMINATION OF IT WE MAY PASS OVER THE METHODS ACCORDING TO WHICH
THE ELECTION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES TAKES PLACE, AS WELL AS THE WAYS
WHICH BRING THEM INTO OFFICE AND BESTOW NEW TITLES ON THEM. IT IS QUITE
EVIDENT THAT ONLY TO A TINY DEGREE ARE PUBLIC WISHES OR PUBLIC
NECESSITIES SATISFIED BY THE MANNER IN WHICH AN ELECTION TAKES PLACE;
FOR EVERYBODY WHO PROPERLY ESTIMATES THE POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE OF THE
MASSES CAN EASILY SEE THAT THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY DEVELOPED TO ENABLE
THEM TO FORM GENERAL POLITICAL JUDGMENTS ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT, OR TO
SELECT THE MEN WHO MIGHT BE COMPETENT TO CARRY OUT THEIR IDEAS IN
PRACTICE.

WHATEVER DEFINITION WE MAY GIVE OF THE TERM 'PUBLIC OPINION', ONLY A
VERY SMALL PART OF IT ORIGINATES FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OR INDIVIDUAL
INSIGHT. THE GREATER PORTION OF IT RESULTS FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH
PUBLIC MATTERS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO THE PEOPLE THROUGH AN
OVERWHELMINGLY IMPRESSIVE AND PERSISTENT SYSTEM OF 'INFORMATION'.

IN THE RELIGIOUS SPHERE THE PROFESSION OF A DENOMINATIONAL BELIEF IS
LARGELY THE RESULT OF EDUCATION, WHILE THE RELIGIOUS YEARNING ITSELF
SLUMBERS IN THE SOUL; SO TOO THE POLITICAL OPINIONS OF THE MASSES ARE
THE FINAL RESULT OF INFLUENCES SYSTEMATICALLY OPERATING ON HUMAN
SENTIMENT AND INTELLIGENCE IN VIRTUE OF A METHOD WHICH IS APPLIED
SOMETIMES WITH ALMOST-INCREDIBLE THOROUGHNESS AND PERSEVERANCE.

BY FAR THE MOST EFFECTIVE BRANCH OF POLITICAL EDUCATION, WHICH IN THIS
CONNECTION IS BEST EXPRESSED BY THE WORD 'PROPAGANDA', IS CARRIED ON BY
THE PRESS. THE PRESS IS THE CHIEF MEANS EMPLOYED IN THE PROCESS OF
POLITICAL 'ENLIGHTENMENT'. IT REPRESENTS A KIND OF SCHOOL FOR ADULTS.
THIS EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY, HOWEVER, IS NOT IN THE HANDS OF THE STATE BUT
IN THE CLUTCHES OF POWERS WHICH ARE PARTLY OF A VERY INFERIOR CHARACTER.
WHILE STILL A YOUNG MAN IN VIENNA I HAD EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR
COMING TO KNOW THE MEN WHO OWNED THIS MACHINE FOR MASS INSTRUCTION, AS
WELL AS THOSE WHO SUPPLIED IT WITH THE IDEAS IT DISTRIBUTED. AT FIRST I
WAS QUITE SURPRISED WHEN I REALIZED HOW LITTLE TIME WAS NECESSARY FOR
THIS DANGEROUS GREAT POWER WITHIN THE STATE TO PRODUCE A CERTAIN BELIEF
AMONG THE PUBLIC; AND IN DOING SO THE GENUINE WILL AND CONVICTIONS OF
THE PUBLIC WERE OFTEN COMPLETELY MISCONSTRUED. IT TOOK THE PRESS ONLY A
FEW DAYS TO TRANSFORM SOME RIDICULOUSLY TRIVIAL MATTER INTO AN ISSUE OF
NATIONAL IMPORTANCE, WHILE VITAL PROBLEMS WERE COMPLETELY IGNORED OR
FILCHED AND HIDDEN AWAY FROM PUBLIC ATTENTION.

THE PRESS SUCCEEDED IN THE MAGICAL ART OF PRODUCING NAMES FROM NOWHERE
WITHIN THE COURSE OF A FEW WEEKS. THEY MADE IT APPEAR THAT THE GREAT
HOPES OF THE MASSES WERE BOUND UP WITH THOSE NAMES. AND SO THEY MADE
THOSE NAMES MORE POPULAR THAN ANY MAN OF REAL ABILITY COULD EVER HOPE TO
BE IN A LONG LIFETIME. ALL THIS WAS DONE, DESPITE THE FACT THAT SUCH
NAMES WERE UTTERLY UNKNOWN AND INDEED HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD OF EVEN UP TO
A MONTH BEFORE THE PRESS PUBLICLY EMBLAZONED THEM. AT THE SAME TIME OLD
AND TRIED FIGURES IN THE POLITICAL AND OTHER SPHERES OF LIFE QUICKLY
FADED FROM THE PUBLIC MEMORY AND WERE FORGOTTEN AS IF THEY WERE DEAD,
THOUGH STILL HEALTHY AND IN THE ENJOYMENT OF THEIR FULL VIGUOUR. OR
SOMETIMES SUCH MEN WERE SO VILELY ABUSED THAT IT LOOKED AS IF THEIR
NAMES WOULD SOON STAND AS PERMANENT SYMBOLS OF THE WORST KIND OF
BASENESS. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE PROPERLY THE REALLY PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE
WHICH THE PRESS CAN EXERCISE ONE HAD TO STUDY THIS INFAMOUS JEWISH
METHOD WHEREBY HONOURABLE AND DECENT PEOPLE WERE BESMIRCHED WITH MUD AND
FILTH, IN THE FORM OF LOW ABUSE AND SLANDER, FROM HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS
OF QUARTERS SIMULTANEOUSLY, AS IF COMMANDED BY SOME MAGIC FORMULA.

THESE HIGHWAY ROBBERS WOULD GRAB AT ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT SERVE THEIR
EVIL ENDS.

THEY WOULD POKE THEIR NOSES INTO THE MOST INTIMATE FAMILY AFFAIRS AND
WOULD NOT REST UNTIL THEY HAD SNIFFED OUT SOME PETTY ITEM WHICH COULD BE
USED TO DESTROY THE REPUTATION OF THEIR VICTIM. BUT IF THE RESULT OF ALL
THIS SNIFFING SHOULD BE THAT NOTHING DEROGATORY WAS DISCOVERED IN THE
PRIVATE OR PUBLIC LIFE OF THE VICTIM, THEY CONTINUED TO HURL ABUSE AT
HIM, IN THE BELIEF THAT SOME OF THEIR ANIMADVERSIONS WOULD STICK EVEN
THOUGH REFUTED A THOUSAND TIMES. IN MOST CASES IT FINALLY TURNED OUT
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE VICTIM TO CONTINUE HIS DEFENCE, BECAUSE THE ACCUSER
WORKED TOGETHER WITH SO MANY ACCOMPLICES THAT HIS SLANDERS WERE
RE-ECHOED INTERMINABLY. BUT THESE SLANDERERS WOULD NEVER OWN THAT THEY
WERE ACTING FROM MOTIVES WHICH INFLUENCE THE COMMON RUN OF HUMANITY OR
ARE UNDERSTOOD BY THEM. OH, NO. THE SCOUNDREL WHO DEFAMED HIS
CONTEMPORARIES IN THIS VILLAINOUS WAY WOULD CROWN HIMSELF WITH A HALO OF
HEROIC PROBITY FASHIONED OF UNCTUOUS PHRASEOLOGY AND TWADDLE ABOUT HIS
'DUTIES AS A JOURNALIST' AND OTHER MOULDY NONSENSE OF THAT KIND. WHEN
THESE CUTTLE-FISHES GATHERED TOGETHER IN LARGE SHOALS AT MEETINGS AND
CONGRESSES THEY WOULD GIVE OUT A LOT OF SLIMY TALK ABOUT A SPECIAL KIND
OF HONOUR WHICH THEY CALLED THE PROFESSIONAL HONOUR OF THE JOURNALIST.
THEN THE ASSEMBLED SPECIES WOULD BOW THEIR RESPECTS TO ONE ANOTHER.

THESE ARE THE KIND OF BEINGS THAT FABRICATE MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS OF WHAT
IS CALLED PUBLIC OPINION, FROM THE FOAM OF WHICH THE PARLIAMENTARY
APHRODITE EVENTUALLY ARISES.

SEVERAL VOLUMES WOULD BE NEEDED IF ONE WERE TO GIVE AN ADEQUATE ACCOUNT
OF THE WHOLE PROCEDURE AND FULLY DESCRIBE ALL ITS HOLLOW FALLACIES. BUT
IF WE PASS OVER THE DETAILS AND LOOK AT THE PRODUCT ITSELF WHILE IT IS
IN OPERATION I THINK THIS ALONE WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO OPEN THE EYES OF
EVEN THE MOST INNOCENT AND CREDULOUS PERSON, SO THAT HE MAY RECOGNIZE
THE ABSURDITY OF THIS INSTITUTION BY LOOKING AT IT OBJECTIVELY.

IN ORDER TO REALIZE HOW THIS HUMAN ABERRATION IS AS HARMFUL AS IT IS
ABSURD, THE TEST AND EASIEST METHOD IS TO COMPARE DEMOCRATIC
PARLIAMENTARIANISM WITH A GENUINE GERMAN DEMOCRACY.

THE REMARKABLE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PARLIAMENTARY FORM OF DEMOCRACY IS
THE FACT THAT A NUMBER OF PERSONS, LET US SAY FIVE HUNDRED--INCLUDING,
IN RECENT TIME, WOMEN ALSO--ARE ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT AND INVESTED WITH
AUTHORITY TO GIVE FINAL JUDGMENT ON ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. IN PRACTICE
THEY ALONE ARE THE GOVERNING BODY; FOR ALTHOUGH THEY MAY APPOINT A
CABINET, WHICH SEEMS OUTWARDLY TO DIRECT THE AFFAIRS OF STATE, THIS
CABINET HAS NOT A REAL EXISTENCE OF ITS OWN. IN REALITY THE SO-CALLED
GOVERNMENT CANNOT DO ANYTHING AGAINST THE WILL OF THE ASSEMBLY. IT CAN
NEVER BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT FOR ANYTHING, SINCE THE RIGHT OF DECISION IS
NOT VESTED IN THE CABINET BUT IN THE PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY. THE CABINET
ALWAYS FUNCTIONS ONLY AS THE EXECUTOR OF THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY. ITS
POLITICAL ABILITY CAN BE JUDGED ONLY ACCORDING TO HOW FAR IT SUCCEEDS IN
ADJUSTING ITSELF TO THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY OR IN PERSUADING THE
MAJORITY TO AGREE TO ITS PROPOSALS. BUT THIS MEANS THAT IT MUST DESCEND
FROM THE LEVEL OF A REAL GOVERNING POWER TO THAT OF A MENDICANT WHO HAS
TO BEG THE APPROVAL OF A MAJORITY THAT MAY BE GOT TOGETHER FOR THE TIME
BEING. INDEED, THE CHIEF PREOCCUPATION OF THE CABINET MUST BE TO SECURE
FOR ITSELF, IN THE CASE OF' EACH INDIVIDUAL MEASURE, THE FAVOUR OF THE
MAJORITY THEN IN POWER OR, FAILING THAT, TO FORM A NEW MAJORITY THAT
WILL BE MORE FAVOURABLY DISPOSED. IF IT SHOULD SUCCEED IN EITHER OF
THESE EFFORTS IT MAY GO ON 'GOVERNING' FOR A LITTLE WHILE. IF IT SHOULD
FAIL TO WIN OR FORM A MAJORITY IT MUST RETIRE. THE QUESTION WHETHER ITS
POLICY AS SUCH HAS BEEN RIGHT OR WRONG DOES NOT MATTER AT ALL.

THEREBY ALL RESPONSIBILITY IS ABOLISHED IN PRACTICE. TO WHAT
CONSEQUENCES SUCH A STATE OF AFFAIRS CAN LEAD MAY EASILY BE UNDERSTOOD
FROM THE FOLLOWING SIMPLE CONSIDERATIONS:

THOSE FIVE HUNDRED DEPUTIES WHO HAVE BEEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE COME
FROM VARIOUS DISSIMILAR CALLINGS IN LIFE AND SHOW VERY VARYING DEGREES
OF POLITICAL CAPACITY, WITH THE RESULT THAT THE WHOLE COMBINATION IS
DISJOINTED AND SOMETIMES PRESENTS QUITE A SORRY PICTURE. SURELY NOBODY
BELIEVES THAT THESE CHOSEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION ARE THE CHOICE
SPIRITS OR FIRST-CLASS INTELLECTS. NOBODY, I HOPE, IS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO
PRETEND THAT HUNDREDS OF STATESMEN CAN EMERGE FROM PAPERS PLACED IN THE
BALLOT BOX BY ELECTORS WHO ARE ANYTHING ELSE BUT AVERAGELY INTELLIGENT.
THE ABSURD NOTION THAT MEN OF GENIUS ARE BORN OUT OF UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE
CANNOT BE TOO STRONGLY REPUDIATED. IN THE FIRST PLACE, THOSE TIMES MAY
BE REALLY CALLED BLESSED WHEN ONE GENUINE STATESMAN MAKES HIS APPEARANCE
AMONG A PEOPLE. SUCH STATESMEN DO NOT APPEAR ALL AT ONCE IN HUNDREDS OR
MORE. SECONDLY, AMONG THE BROAD MASSES THERE IS INSTINCTIVELY A DEFINITE
ANTIPATHY TOWARDS EVERY OUTSTANDING GENIUS. THERE IS A BETTER CHANCE OF
SEEING A CAMEL PASS THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE THAN OF SEEING A REALLY
GREAT MAN 'DISCOVERED' THROUGH AN ELECTION.

WHATEVER HAS HAPPENED IN HISTORY ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE AVERAGE OF THE
BROAD PUBLIC HAS MOSTLY BEEN DUE TO THE DRIVING FORCE OF AN INDIVIDUAL
PERSONALITY.

BUT HERE FIVE HUNDRED PERSONS OF LESS THAN MODEST INTELLECTUAL QUALITIES
PASS JUDGMENT ON THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE NATION. THEY
FORM GOVERNMENTS WHICH IN TURN LEARN TO WIN THE APPROVAL OF THE
ILLUSTRIOUS ASSEMBLY FOR EVERY LEGISLATIVE STEP THAT MAY BE TAKEN, WHICH
MEANS THAT THE POLICY TO BE CARRIED OUT IS ACTUALLY THE POLICY OF THE
FIVE HUNDRED.

AND INDEED, GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE POLICY BEARS THE STAMP OF ITS
ORIGIN.

BUT LET US PASS OVER THE INTELLECTUAL QUALITIES OF THESE REPRESENTATIVES
AND ASK WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE TASK SET BEFORE THEM. IF WE CONSIDER
THE FACT THAT THE PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED AND SOLVED BELONG
TO THE MOST VARIED AND DIVERSE FIELDS WE CAN VERY WELL REALIZE HOW
INEFFICIENT A GOVERNING SYSTEM MUST BE WHICH ENTRUSTS THE RIGHT OF
DECISION TO A MASS ASSEMBLY IN WHICH ONLY VERY FEW POSSESS THE KNOWLEDGE
AND EXPERIENCE SUCH AS WOULD QUALIFY THEM TO DEAL WITH THE MATTERS THAT
HAVE TO BE SETTLED. THE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC MEASURES ARE SUBMITTED
TO A TRIBUNAL IN WHICH NOT MORE THAN ONE-TENTH OF THE MEMBERS HAVE
STUDIED THE ELEMENTS OF ECONOMICS. THIS MEANS THAT FINAL AUTHORITY IS
VESTED IN MEN WHO ARE UTTERLY DEVOID OF ANY PREPARATORY TRAINING WHICH
MIGHT MAKE THEM COMPETENT TO DECIDE ON THE QUESTIONS AT ISSUE.

THE SAME HOLDS TRUE OF EVERY OTHER PROBLEM. IT IS ALWAYS A MAJORITY OF
IGNORANT AND INCOMPETENT PEOPLE WHO DECIDE ON EACH MEASURE; FOR THE
COMPOSITION OF THE INSTITUTION DOES NOT VARY, WHILE THE PROBLEMS TO BE
DEALT WITH COME FROM THE MOST VARIED SPHERES OF PUBLIC LIFE. AN
INTELLIGENT JUDGMENT WOULD BE POSSIBLE ONLY IF DIFFERENT DEPUTIES HAD
THE AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH DIFFERENT ISSUES. IT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION
TO THINK THAT THE SAME PEOPLE ARE FITTED TO DECIDE ON TRANSPORT
QUESTIONS AS WELL AS, LET US SAY, ON QUESTIONS OF FOREIGN POLICY, UNLESS
EACH OF THEM BE A UNIVERSAL GENIUS. BUT SCARCELY MORE THAN ONE GENIUS
APPEARS IN A CENTURY. HERE WE ARE SCARCELY EVER DEALING WITH REAL
BRAINS, BUT ONLY WITH DILETTANTI WHO ARE AS NARROW-MINDED AS THEY ARE
CONCEITED AND ARROGANT, INTELLECTUAL DEMI-MONDES OF THE WORST KIND. THIS
IS WHY THESE HONOURABLE GENTLEMEN SHOW SUCH ASTONISHING LEVITY IN
DISCUSSING AND DECIDING ON MATTERS THAT WOULD DEMAND THE MOST
PAINSTAKING CONSIDERATION EVEN FROM GREAT MINDS. MEASURES OF MOMENTOUS
IMPORTANCE FOR THE FUTURE EXISTENCE OF THE STATE ARE FRAMED AND
DISCUSSED IN AN ATMOSPHERE MORE SUITED TO THE CARD-TABLE. INDEED THE
LATTER SUGGESTS A MUCH MORE FITTING OCCUPATION FOR THESE GENTLEMEN THAN
THAT OF DECIDING THE DESTINIES OF A PEOPLE.

OF COURSE IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO ASSUME THAT EACH MEMBER IN SUCH A
PARLIAMENT WAS ENDOWED BY NATURE WITH SUCH A SMALL SENSE OF
RESPONSIBILITY. THAT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION.

BUT THIS SYSTEM, BY FORCING THE INDIVIDUAL TO PASS JUDGMENT ON QUESTIONS
FOR WHICH HE IS NOT COMPETENT GRADUALLY DEBASES HIS MORAL CHARACTER.
NOBODY WILL HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY: "GENTLEMEN, I AM AFRAID WE KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. I FOR ONE HAVE NO COMPETENCY IN
THE MATTER AT ALL." ANYHOW IF SUCH A DECLARATION WERE MADE IT WOULD NOT
CHANGE MATTERS VERY MUCH; FOR SUCH OUTSPOKEN HONESTY WOULD NOT BE
UNDERSTOOD. THE PERSON WHO MADE THE DECLARATION WOULD BE DEEMED AN
HONOURABLE ASS WHO OUGHT NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO SPOIL THE GAME. THOSE WHO
HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE KNOW THAT NOBODY LIKES TO BE CONSIDERED
A FOOL AMONG HIS ASSOCIATES; AND IN CERTAIN CIRCLES HONESTY IS TAKEN AS
AN INDEX OF STUPIDITY.

THUS IT HAPPENS THAT A NATURALLY UPRIGHT MAN, ONCE HE FINDS HIMSELF
ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT, MAY EVENTUALLY BE INDUCED BY THE FORCE OF
CIRCUMSTANCES TO ACQUIESCE IN A GENERAL LINE OF CONDUCT WHICH IS BASE IN
ITSELF AND AMOUNTS TO A BETRAYAL OF THE PUBLIC TRUST. THAT FEELING THAT
IF THE INDIVIDUAL REFRAINED FROM TAKING PART IN A CERTAIN DECISION HIS
ATTITUDE WOULD NOT ALTER THE SITUATION IN THE LEAST, DESTROYS EVERY REAL
SENSE OF HONOUR WHICH MIGHT OCCASIONALLY AROUSE THE CONSCIENCE OF ONE
PERSON OR ANOTHER. FINALLY, THE OTHERWISE UPRIGHT DEPUTY WILL SUCCEED IN
PERSUADING HIMSELF THAT HE IS BY NO MEANS THE WORST OF THE LOT AND THAT
BY TAKING PART IN A CERTAIN LINE OF ACTION HE MAY PREVENT SOMETHING
WORSE FROM HAPPENING.

A COUNTER ARGUMENT MAY BE PUT FORWARD HERE. IT MAY BE SAID THAT OF
COURSE THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBER MAY NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS
REQUISITE FOR THE TREATMENT OF THIS OR THAT QUESTION, YET HIS ATTITUDE
TOWARDS IT IS TAKEN ON THE ADVICE OF HIS PARTY AS THE GUIDING AUTHORITY
IN EACH POLITICAL MATTER; AND IT MAY FURTHER BE SAID THAT THE PARTY SETS
UP SPECIAL COMMITTEES OF EXPERTS WHO HAVE EVEN MORE THAN THE REQUISITE
KNOWLEDGE FOR DEALING WITH THE QUESTIONS PLACED BEFORE THEM.

AT FIRST SIGHT, THAT ARGUMENT SEEMS SOUND. BUT THEN ANOTHER QUESTION
ARISES--NAMELY, WHY ARE FIVE HUNDRED PERSONS ELECTED IF ONLY A FEW HAVE
THE WISDOM WHICH IS REQUIRED TO DEAL WITH THE MORE IMPORTANT PROBLEMS?

IT IS NOT THE AIM OF OUR MODERN DEMOCRATIC PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM TO BRING
TOGETHER AN ASSEMBLY OF INTELLIGENT AND WELL-INFORMED DEPUTIES. NOT AT
ALL. THE AIM RATHER IS TO BRING TOGETHER A GROUP OF NONENTITIES WHO ARE
DEPENDENT ON OTHERS FOR THEIR VIEWS AND WHO CAN BE ALL THE MORE EASILY
LED, THE NARROWER THE MENTAL OUTLOOK OF EACH INDIVIDUAL IS. THAT IS THE
ONLY WAY IN WHICH A PARTY POLICY, ACCORDING TO THE EVIL MEANING IT HAS
TO-DAY, CAN BE PUT INTO EFFECT. AND BY THIS METHOD ALONE IT IS POSSIBLE
FOR THE WIREPULLER, WHO EXERCISES THE REAL CONTROL, TO REMAIN IN THE
DARK, SO THAT PERSONALLY HE CAN NEVER BE BROUGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS
ACTIONS. FOR UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES NONE OF THE DECISIONS TAKEN, NO
MATTER HOW DISASTROUS THEY MAY TURN OUT FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE, CAN
BE LAID AT THE DOOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHOM EVERYBODY KNOWS TO BE THE
EVIL GENIUS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WHOLE AFFAIR. ALL RESPONSIBILITY IS
SHIFTED TO THE SHOULDERS OF THE PARTY AS A WHOLE.

IN PRACTICE NO ACTUAL RESPONSIBILITY REMAINS. FOR RESPONSIBILITY ARISES
ONLY FROM PERSONAL DUTY AND NOT FROM THE OBLIGATIONS THAT REST WITH A
PARLIAMENTARY ASSEMBLY OF EMPTY TALKERS.

THE PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTION ATTRACTS PEOPLE OF THE BADGER TYPE, WHO DO
NOT LIKE THE OPEN LIGHT. NO UPRIGHT MAN, WHO IS READY TO ACCEPT PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS ACTS, WILL BE ATTRACTED TO SUCH AN INSTITUTION.

THAT IS THE REASON WHY THIS BRAND OF DEMOCRACY HAS BECOME A TOOL IN THE
HAND OF THAT RACE WHICH, BECAUSE OF THE INNER PURPOSES IT WISHES TO
ATTAIN, MUST SHUN THE OPEN LIGHT, AS IT HAS ALWAYS DONE AND ALWAYS WILL
DO. ONLY A JEW CAN PRAISE AN INSTITUTION WHICH IS AS CORRUPT AND FALSE
AS HIMSELF.

AS A CONTRAST TO THIS KIND OF DEMOCRACY WE HAVE THE GERMAN DEMOCRACY,
WHICH IS A TRUE DEMOCRACY; FOR HERE THE LEADER IS FREELY CHOSEN AND IS
OBLIGED TO ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL HIS ACTIONS AND OMISSIONS.
THE PROBLEMS TO BE DEALT WITH ARE NOT PUT TO THE VOTE OF THE MAJORITY;
BUT THEY ARE DECIDED UPON BY THE INDIVIDUAL, AND AS A GUARANTEE OF
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE DECISIONS HE PLEDGES ALL HE HAS IN THE WORLD
AND EVEN HIS LIFE.

THE OBJECTION MAY BE RAISED HERE THAT UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS IT WOULD BE
VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND A MAN WHO WOULD BE READY TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO SO
FATEFUL A TASK. THE ANSWER TO THAT OBJECTION IS AS FOLLOWS:

WE THANK GOD THAT THE INNER SPIRIT OF OUR GERMAN DEMOCRACY WILL OF
ITSELF PREVENT THE CHANCE CAREERIST, WHO MAY BE INTELLECTUALLY WORTHLESS
AND A MORAL TWISTER, FROM COMING BY DEVIOUS WAYS TO A POSITION IN WHICH
HE MAY GOVERN HIS FELLOW-CITIZENS. THE FEAR OF UNDERTAKING SUCH
FAR-REACHING RESPONSIBILITIES, UNDER GERMAN DEMOCRACY, WILL SCARE OFF
THE IGNORANT AND THE FECKLESS.

BUT SHOULD IT HAPPEN THAT SUCH A PERSON MIGHT CREEP IN SURREPTITIOUSLY
IT WILL BE EASY ENOUGH TO IDENTIFY HIM AND APOSTROPHIZE HIM RUTHLESSLY.
SOMEWHAT THUS: "BE OFF, YOU SCOUNDREL. DON'T SOIL THESE STEPS WITH YOUR
FEET; BECAUSE THESE ARE THE STEPS THAT LEAD TO THE PORTALS OF THE
PANTHEON OF HISTORY, AND THEY ARE NOT MEANT FOR PLACE-HUNTERS BUT FOR
MEN OF NOBLE CHARACTER."

SUCH WERE THE VIEWS I FORMED AFTER TWO YEARS OF ATTENDANCE AT THE
SESSIONS OF THE VIENNESE PARLIAMENT. THEN I WENT THERE NO MORE.

THE PARLIAMENTARY REGIME BECAME ONE OF THE CAUSES WHY THE STRENGTH OF
THE HABSBURG STATE STEADILY DECLINED DURING THE LAST YEARS OF ITS
EXISTENCE. THE MORE THE PREDOMINANCE OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT WAS WHITTLED
AWAY THROUGH PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE, THE MORE PROMINENT BECAME THE
SYSTEM OF PLAYING OFF ONE OF THE VARIOUS CONSTITUENT NATIONALITIES
AGAINST THE OTHER. IN THE IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT IT WAS ALWAYS THE GERMAN
ELEMENT THAT SUFFERED THROUGH THE SYSTEM, WHICH MEANT THAT THE RESULTS
WERE DETRIMENTAL TO THE EMPIRE AS A WHOLE; FOR AT THE CLOSE OF THE
CENTURY EVEN THE MOST SIMPLE-MINDED PEOPLE COULD RECOGNIZE THAT THE
COHESIVE FORCES WITHIN THE DUAL MONARCHY NO LONGER SUFFICED TO
COUNTERBALANCE THE SEPARATIST TENDENCIES OF THE PROVINCIAL
NATIONALITIES. ON THE CONTRARY!

THE MEASURES WHICH THE STATE ADOPTED FOR ITS OWN MAINTENANCE BECAME MORE
AND MORE MEAN SPIRITED AND IN A LIKE DEGREE THE GENERAL DISRESPECT FOR
THE STATE INCREASED. NOT ONLY HUNGARY BUT ALSO THE VARIOUS SLAV
PROVINCES GRADUALLY CEASED TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WITH THE MONARCHY
WHICH EMBRACED THEM ALL, AND ACCORDINGLY THEY DID NOT FEEL ITS WEAKNESS
AS IN ANY WAY DETRIMENTAL TO THEMSELVES. THEY RATHER WELCOMED THOSE
MANIFESTATIONS OF SENILE DECAY. THEY LOOKED FORWARD TO THE FINAL
DISSOLUTION OF THE STATE, AND NOT TO ITS RECOVERY.

THE COMPLETE COLLAPSE WAS STILL FORESTALLED IN PARLIAMENT BY THE
HUMILIATING CONCESSIONS THAT WERE MADE TO EVERY KIND OF IMPORTUNATE
DEMANDS, AT THE COST OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT. THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THE
DEFENCE OF THE STATE RESTED ON PLAYING OFF THE VARIOUS NATIONALITIES
AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. BUT THE GENERAL TREND OF THIS DEVELOPMENT WAS
DIRECTED AGAINST THE GERMANS. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE RIGHT OF SUCCESSION
TO THE THRONE CONFERRED CERTAIN INFLUENCE ON THE ARCHDUKE FRANZ
FERDINAND, THE POLICY OF INCREASING THE POWER OF THE CZECHS WAS CARRIED
OUT SYSTEMATICALLY FROM THE UPPER GRADES OF THE ADMINISTRATION DOWN TO
THE LOWER. WITH ALL THE MEANS AT HIS COMMAND THE HEIR TO THE DUAL
MONARCHY PERSONALLY FURTHERED THE POLICY THAT AIMED AT ELIMINATING THE
INFLUENCE OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT, OR AT LEAST HE ACTED AS PROTECTOR OF
THAT POLICY. BY THE USE OF STATE OFFICIALS AS TOOLS, PURELY GERMAN
DISTRICTS WERE GRADUALLY BUT DECISIVELY BROUGHT WITHIN THE DANGER ZONE
OF THE MIXED LANGUAGES. EVEN IN LOWER AUSTRIA THIS PROCESS BEGAN TO MAKE
HEADWAY WITH A CONSTANTLY INCREASING TEMPO AND VIENNA WAS LOOKED UPON BY
THE CZECHS AS THEIR BIGGEST CITY.

IN THE FAMILY CIRCLE OF THIS NEW HABSBURGER THE CZECH LANGUAGE WAS
FAVOURED. THE WIFE OF THE ARCHDUKE HAD FORMERLY BEEN A CZECH COUNTESS
AND WAS WEDDED TO THE PRINCE BY A MORGANATIC MARRIAGE. SHE CAME FROM AN
ENVIRONMENT WHERE HOSTILITY TO THE GERMANS HAD BEEN TRADITIONAL. THE
LEADING IDEA IN THE MIND OF THE ARCHDUKE WAS TO ESTABLISH A SLAV STATE
IN CENTRAL EUROPE, WHICH WAS TO BE CONSTRUCTED ON A PURELY CATHOLIC
BASIS, SO AS TO SERVE AS A BULWARK AGAINST ORTHODOX RUSSIA.

AS HAD HAPPENED OFTEN IN HABSBURG HISTORY, RELIGION WAS THUS EXPLOITED
TO SERVE A PURELY POLITICAL POLICY, AND IN THIS CASE A FATAL POLICY, AT
LEAST AS FAR AS GERMAN INTERESTS WERE CONCERNED. THE RESULT WAS
LAMENTABLE IN MANY RESPECTS.

NEITHER THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG NOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH RECEIVED THE
REWARD WHICH THEY EXPECTED. HABSBURG LOST THE THRONE AND THE CHURCH LOST
A GREAT STATE. BY EMPLOYING RELIGIOUS MOTIVES IN THE SERVICE OF
POLITICS, A SPIRIT WAS AROUSED WHICH THE INSTIGATORS OF THAT POLICY HAD
NEVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

FROM THE ATTEMPT TO EXTERMINATE GERMANISM IN THE OLD MONARCHY BY EVERY
AVAILABLE MEANS AROSE THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT IN AUSTRIA, AS A RESPONSE.

IN THE 'EIGHTIES OF THE LAST CENTURY MANCHESTER LIBERALISM, WHICH WAS
JEWISH IN ITS FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS, HAD REACHED THE ZENITH OF ITS INFLUENCE
IN THE DUAL MONARCHY, OR HAD ALREADY PASSED THAT POINT. THE REACTION
WHICH SET IN DID NOT ARISE FROM SOCIAL BUT FROM NATIONALISTIC
TENDENCIES, AS WAS ALWAYS THE CASE IN THE OLD AUSTRIA. THE INSTINCT OF
SELF-PRESERVATION DROVE THE GERMAN ELEMENT TO DEFEND ITSELF
ENERGETICALLY. ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS ONLY SLOWLY BEGAN TO GAIN AN
IMPORTANT INFLUENCE; BUT THEY WERE OF SECONDARY CONCERN. BUT OF THE
GENERAL POLITICAL CHAOS TWO PARTY ORGANIZATIONS EMERGED. THE ONE WAS
MORE OF A NATIONAL, AND THE OTHER MORE OF A SOCIAL, CHARACTER; BUT BOTH
WERE HIGHLY INTERESTING AND INSTRUCTIVE FOR THE FUTURE.

AFTER THE WAR OF 1866, WHICH HAD RESULTED IN THE HUMILIATION OF AUSTRIA,
THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG CONTEMPLATED A REVANCHE ON THE BATTLEFIELD. ONLY
THE TRAGIC END OF THE EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN OF MEXICO PREVENTED A STILL
CLOSER COLLABORATION WITH FRANCE. THE CHIEF BLAME FOR MAXIMILIAN'S
DISASTROUS EXPEDITION WAS ATTRIBUTED TO NAPOLEON III AND THE FACT THAT
THE FRENCHMAN LEFT HIM IN THE LURCH AROUSED A GENERAL FEELING OF
INDIGNATION. YET THE HABSBURGS WERE STILL LYING IN WAIT FOR THEIR
OPPORTUNITY. IF THE WAR OF 1870-71 HAD NOT BEEN SUCH A SINGULAR TRIUMPH,
THE VIENNESE COURT MIGHT HAVE CHANCED THE GAME OF BLOOD IN ORDER TO GET
ITS REVENGE FOR SADOWA. BUT WHEN THE FIRST REPORTS ARRIVED FROM THE
FRANCO-GERMAN BATTLEFIELD, WHICH, THOUGH TRUE, SEEMED MIRACULOUS AND
ALMOST INCREDIBLE, THE 'MOST WISE' OF ALL MONARCHS RECOGNIZED THAT THE
MOMENT WAS INOPPORTUNE AND TRIED TO ACCEPT THE UNFAVOURABLE SITUATION
WITH AS GOOD A GRACE AS POSSIBLE.

THE HEROIC CONFLICT OF THOSE TWO YEARS (1870-71) PRODUCED A STILL
GREATER MIRACLE; FOR WITH THE HABSBURGS THE CHANGE OF ATTITUDE NEVER
CAME FROM AN INNER HEARTFELT URGE BUT ONLY FROM THE PRESSURE OF
CIRCUMSTANCES. THE GERMAN PEOPLE OF THE EAST MARK, HOWEVER, WERE
ENTRANCED BY THE TRIUMPHANT GLORY OF THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED GERMAN EMPIRE
AND WERE PROFOUNDLY MOVED WHEN THEY SAW THE DREAM OF THEIR FATHERS
RESURGENT IN A MAGNIFICENT REALITY.

FOR--LET US MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT--THE TRUE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN REALIZED
FROM THIS TIME ONWARD, THAT KÃ¶NIGGRÃ¤TZ WAS THE TRAGIC, THOUGH NECESSARY,
PRE-CONDITION FOR THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EMPIRE WHICH SHOULD NO
LONGER BE BURDENED WITH THE PALSY OF THE OLD ALLIANCE AND WHICH INDEED
HAD NO SHARE IN THAT MORBID DECAY. ABOVE ALL, THE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN HAD
COME TO FEEL IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF HIS OWN BEING THAT THE HISTORICAL
MISSION OF THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG HAD COME TO AN END AND THAT THE NEW
EMPIRE COULD CHOOSE ONLY AN EMPEROR WHO WAS OF HEROIC MOULD AND WAS
THEREFORE WORTHY TO WEAR THE 'CROWN OF THE RHINE'. IT WAS RIGHT AND JUST
THAT DESTINY SHOULD BE PRAISED FOR HAVING CHOSEN A SCION OF THAT HOUSE
OF WHICH FREDERICK THE GREAT HAD IN PAST TIMES GIVEN THE NATION AN
ELEVATED AND RESPLENDENT SYMBOL FOR ALL TIME TO COME.

AFTER THE GREAT WAR OF 1870-71 THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG SET TO WORK WITH
ALL ITS DETERMINATION TO EXTERMINATE THE DANGEROUS GERMAN ELEMENT--ABOUT
WHOSE INNER FEELINGS AND ATTITUDE THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT--SLOWLY BUT
DELIBERATELY. I USE THE WORD EXTERMINATE, BECAUSE THAT ALONE EXPRESSES
WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE FINAL RESULT OF THE SLAVOPHILE POLICY. THEN IT
WAS THAT THE FIRE OF REBELLION BLAZED UP AMONG THE PEOPLE WHOSE
EXTERMINATION HAD BEEN DECREED. THAT FIRE WAS SUCH AS HAD NEVER BEEN
WITNESSED IN MODERN GERMAN HISTORY.

FOR THE FIRST TIME NATIONALISTS AND PATRIOTS WERE TRANSFORMED INTO
REBELS.

NOT REBELS AGAINST THE NATION OR THE STATE AS SUCH BUT REBELS AGAINST
THAT FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH THEY WERE CONVINCED, WOULD INEVITABLY
BRING ABOUT THE RUIN OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MODERN
HISTORY THE TRADITIONAL DYNASTIC PATRIOTISM AND NATIONAL LOVE OF
FATHERLAND AND PEOPLE WERE IN OPEN CONFLICT.

IT WAS TO THE MERIT OF THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT IN AUSTRIA DURING THE
CLOSING DECADE OF THE LAST CENTURY THAT IT POINTED OUT CLEARLY AND
UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT A STATE IS ENTITLED TO DEMAND RESPECT AND PROTECTION
FOR ITS AUTHORITY ONLY WHEN SUCH AUTHORITY IS ADMINISTERED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE INTERESTS OF THE NATION, OR AT LEAST NOT IN A MANNER
DETRIMENTAL TO THOSE INTERESTS.

THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE CAN NEVER BE AN END IN ITSELF; FOR, IF THAT
WERE SO, ANY KIND OF TYRANNY WOULD BE INVIOLABLE AND SACRED.

IF A GOVERNMENT USES THE INSTRUMENTS OF POWER IN ITS HANDS FOR THE
PURPOSE OF LEADING A PEOPLE TO RUIN, THEN REBELLION IS NOT ONLY THE
RIGHT BUT ALSO THE DUTY OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN.

THE QUESTION OF WHETHER AND WHEN SUCH A SITUATION EXISTS CANNOT BE
ANSWERED BY THEORETICAL DISSERTATIONS BUT ONLY BY THE EXERCISE OF FORCE,
AND IT IS SUCCESS THAT DECIDES THE ISSUE.

EVERY GOVERNMENT, EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE THE WORST POSSIBLE AND EVEN
THOUGH IT MAY HAVE BETRAYED THE NATION'S TRUST IN THOUSANDS OF WAYS,
WILL CLAIM THAT ITS DUTY IS TO UPHOLD THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE. ITS
ADVERSARIES, WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR NATIONAL SELF-PRESERVATION, MUST USE
THE SAME WEAPONS WHICH THE GOVERNMENT USES IF THEY ARE TO PREVAIL
AGAINST SUCH A RULE AND SECURE THEIR OWN FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE.
THEREFORE THE CONFLICT WILL BE FOUGHT OUT WITH 'LEGAL' MEANS AS LONG AS
THE POWER WHICH IS TO BE OVERTHROWN USES THEM; BUT THE INSURGENTS WILL
NOT HESITATE TO APPLY ILLEGAL MEANS IF THE OPPRESSOR HIMSELF EMPLOYS
THEM.

GENERALLY SPEAKING, WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT THE HIGHEST AIM OF HUMAN
EXISTENCE IS NOT THE MAINTENANCE OF A STATE OF GOVERNMENT BUT RATHER THE
CONSERVATION OF THE RACE.

IF THE RACE IS IN DANGER OF BEING OPPRESSED OR EVEN EXTERMINATED THE
QUESTION OF LEGALITY IS ONLY OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE. THE ESTABLISHED
POWER MAY IN SUCH A CASE EMPLOY ONLY THOSE MEANS WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED AS
'LEGAL'. YET THE INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION ON THE PART OF THE
OPPRESSED WILL ALWAYS JUSTIFY, TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE, THE EMPLOYMENT OF
ALL POSSIBLE RESOURCES.

ONLY ON THE RECOGNITION OF THIS PRINCIPLE WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR THOSE
STRUGGLES TO BE CARRIED THROUGH, OF WHICH HISTORY FURNISHES MAGNIFICENT
EXAMPLES IN ABUNDANCE, AGAINST FOREIGN BONDAGE OR OPPRESSION AT HOME.

HUMAN RIGHTS ARE ABOVE THE RIGHTS OF THE STATE. BUT IF A PEOPLE BE
DEFEATED IN THE STRUGGLE FOR ITS HUMAN RIGHTS THIS MEANS THAT ITS WEIGHT
HAS PROVED TOO LIGHT IN THE SCALE OF DESTINY TO HAVE THE LUCK OF BEING
ABLE TO ENDURE IN THIS TERRESTRIAL WORLD.

THE WORLD IS NOT THERE TO BE POSSESSED BY THE FAINT-HEARTED RACES.



AUSTRIA AFFORDS A VERY CLEAR AND STRIKING EXAMPLE OF HOW EASY IT IS FOR
TYRANNY TO HIDE ITS HEAD UNDER THE CLOAK OF WHAT IS CALLED 'LEGALITY'.

THE LEGAL EXERCISE OF POWER IN THE HABSBURG STATE WAS THEN BASED ON THE
ANTI-GERMAN ATTITUDE OF THE PARLIAMENT, WITH ITS NON-GERMAN MAJORITIES,
AND ON THE DYNASTIC HOUSE, WHICH WAS ALSO HOSTILE TO THE GERMAN ELEMENT.
THE WHOLE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE WAS INCORPORATED IN THESE TWO FACTORS.
TO ATTEMPT TO ALTER THE LOT OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT THROUGH THESE TWO
FACTORS WOULD HAVE BEEN SENSELESS. THOSE WHO ADVISED THE 'LEGAL' WAY AS
THE ONLY POSSIBLE WAY, AND ALSO OBEDIENCE TO THE STATE AUTHORITY, COULD
OFFER NO RESISTANCE; BECAUSE A POLICY OF RESISTANCE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN
PUT INTO EFFECT THROUGH LEGAL MEASURES. TO FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF THE
LEGALIST COUNSELLORS WOULD HAVE MEANT THE INEVITABLE RUIN OF THE GERMAN
ELEMENT WITHIN THE MONARCHY, AND THIS DISASTER WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN LONG
TO COME. THE GERMAN ELEMENT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN SAVED ONLY BECAUSE THE
STATE AS SUCH COLLAPSED.

THE SPECTACLED THEORIST WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS LIFE FOR HIS DOCTRINE
RATHER THAN FOR HIS PEOPLE.

BECAUSE MAN HAS MADE LAWS HE SUBSEQUENTLY COMES TO THINK THAT HE EXISTS
FOR THE SAKE OF THE LAWS.

A GREAT SERVICE RENDERED BY THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT THEN WAS THAT IT
ABOLISHED ALL SUCH NONSENSE, THOUGH THE DOCTRINAIRE THEORISTS AND OTHER
FETISH WORSHIPPERS WERE SHOCKED.

WHEN THE HABSBURGS ATTEMPTED TO COME TO CLOSE QUARTERS WITH THE GERMAN
ELEMENT, BY THE EMPLOYMENT OF ALL THE MEANS OF ATTACK WHICH THEY HAD AT
THEIR COMMAND, THE PAN-GERMAN PARTY HIT OUT RUTHLESSLY AGAINST THE
'ILLUSTRIOUS' DYNASTY. THIS PARTY WAS THE FIRST TO PROBE INTO AND EXPOSE
THE CORRUPT CONDITION OF THE STATE; AND IN DOING SO THEY OPENED THE EYES
OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. TO HAVE LIBERATED THE HIGH IDEAL OF LOVE FOR
ONE'S COUNTRY FROM THE EMBRACE OF THIS DEPLORABLE DYNASTY WAS ONE OF THE
GREAT SERVICES RENDERED BY THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT.

WHEN THAT PARTY FIRST MADE ITS APPEARANCE IT SECURED A LARGE
FOLLOWING--INDEED, THE MOVEMENT THREATENED TO BECOME ALMOST AN
AVALANCHE. BUT THE FIRST SUCCESSES WERE NOT MAINTAINED. AT THE TIME I
CAME TO VIENNA THE PAN-GERMAN PARTY HAD BEEN ECLIPSED BY THE
CHRISTIAN-SOCIALIST PARTY, WHICH HAD COME INTO POWER IN THE MEANTIME.
INDEED, THE PAN-GERMAN PARTY HAD SUNK TO A LEVEL OF ALMOST COMPLETE
INSIGNIFICANCE.

THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT ON THE ONE HAND AND THE
MARVELLOUS PROGRESS OF THE CHRISTIAN-SOCIALIST PARTY ON THE OTHER,
BECAME A CLASSIC OBJECT OF STUDY FOR ME, AND AS SUCH THEY PLAYED AN
IMPORTANT PART IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MY OWN VIEWS.

WHEN I CAME TO VIENNA ALL MY SYMPATHIES WERE EXCLUSIVELY WITH THE
PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT.

I WAS JUST AS MUCH IMPRESSED BY THE FACT THAT THEY HAD THE COURAGE TO
SHOUT HEIL HOHENZOLLERN AS I REJOICED AT THEIR DETERMINATION TO CONSIDER
THEMSELVES AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE, FROM WHICH THEY WERE
SEPARATED ONLY PROVISIONALLY. THEY NEVER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPLAIN THEIR ATTITUDE IN PUBLIC, WHICH RAISED MY ENTHUSIASM AND
CONFIDENCE. TO AVOW ONE'S PRINCIPLES PUBLICLY ON EVERY PROBLEM THAT
CONCERNED GERMANISM, AND NEVER TO MAKE ANY COMPROMISES, SEEMED TO ME THE
ONLY WAY OF SAVING OUR PEOPLE. WHAT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WAS HOW THIS
MOVEMENT BROKE DOWN SO SOON AFTER SUCH A MAGNIFICENT START; AND IT WAS
NO LESS INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT THE CHRISTIAN-SOCIALISTS SHOULD GAIN SUCH
TREMENDOUS POWER WITHIN SUCH A SHORT TIME. THEY HAD JUST REACHED THE
PINNACLE OF THEIR POPULARITY.

WHEN I BEGAN TO COMPARE THOSE TWO MOVEMENTS FATE PLACED BEFORE ME THE
BEST MEANS OF UNDERSTANDING THE CAUSES OF THIS PUZZLING PROBLEM. THE
ACTION OF FATE IN THIS CASE WAS HASTENED BY MY OWN STRAITENED
CIRCUMSTANCES.

I SHALL BEGIN MY ANALYSIS WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE TWO MEN WHO MUST BE
REGARDED AS THE FOUNDERS AND LEADERS OF THE TWO MOVEMENTS. THESE WERE
GEORGE VON SCHÃ¶NERER AND DR. KARL LUEGER.

AS FAR AS PERSONALITY GOES, BOTH WERE FAR ABOVE THE LEVEL AND STATURE OF
THE SO-CALLED PARLIAMENTARY FIGURES. THEY LIVED LIVES OF IMMACULATE AND
IRREPROACHABLE PROBITY AMIDST THE MIASMA OF ALL-ROUND POLITICAL
CORRUPTION. PERSONALLY I FIRST LIKED THE PAN-GERMAN REPRESENTATIVE,
SCHÃ¶NERER, AND IT WAS ONLY AFTERWARDS AND GRADUALLY THAT I FELT AN EQUAL
LIKING FOR THE CHRISTIAN-SOCIALIST LEADER.

WHEN I COMPARED THEIR RESPECTIVE ABILITIES SCHÃ¶NERER SEEMED TO ME A
BETTER AND MORE PROFOUND THINKER ON FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS. HE FORESAW THE
INEVITABLE DOWNFALL OF THE AUSTRIAN STATE MORE CLEARLY AND ACCURATELY
THAN ANYONE ELSE. IF THIS WARNING IN REGARD TO THE HABSBURG EMPIRE HAD
BEEN HEEDED IN GERMANY THE DISASTROUS WORLD WAR, WHICH INVOLVED GERMANY
AGAINST THE WHOLE OF EUROPE, WOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

BUT THOUGH SCHÃ¶NERER SUCCEEDED IN PENETRATING TO THE ESSENTIALS OF A
PROBLEM HE WAS VERY OFTEN MUCH MISTAKEN IN HIS JUDGMENT OF MEN.

AND HEREIN LAY DR. LUEGER'S SPECIAL TALENT. HE HAD A RARE GIFT OF
INSIGHT INTO HUMAN NATURE AND HE WAS VERY CAREFUL NOT TO TAKE MEN AS
SOMETHING BETTER THAN THEY WERE IN REALITY. HE BASED HIS PLANS ON THE
PRACTICAL POSSIBILITIES WHICH HUMAN LIFE OFFERED HIM, WHEREAS SCHÃ¶NERER
HAD ONLY LITTLE DISCRIMINATION IN THAT RESPECT. ALL IDEAS THAT THIS
PAN-GERMAN HAD WERE RIGHT IN THE ABSTRACT, BUT HE DID NOT HAVE THE
FORCEFULNESS OR UNDERSTANDING NECESSARY TO PUT HIS IDEAS ACROSS TO THE
BROAD MASSES. HE WAS NOT ABLE TO FORMULATE THEM SO THAT THEY COULD BE
EASILY GRASPED BY THE MASSES, WHOSE POWERS OF COMPREHENSION ARE LIMITED
AND WILL ALWAYS REMAIN SO. THEREFORE ALL SCHÃ¶NERER'S KNOWLEDGE WAS ONLY
THE WISDOM OF A PROPHET AND HE NEVER COULD SUCCEED IN HAVING IT PUT INTO
PRACTICE.

THIS LACK OF INSIGHT INTO HUMAN NATURE LED HIM TO FORM A WRONG ESTIMATE
OF THE FORCES BEHIND CERTAIN MOVEMENTS AND THE INHERENT STRENGTH OF OLD
INSTITUTIONS.

SCHÃ¶NERER INDEED REALIZED THAT THE PROBLEMS HE HAD TO DEAL WITH WERE IN
THE NATURE OF A WELTANSCHAUUNG; BUT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT ONLY THE
BROAD MASSES OF A NATION CAN MAKE SUCH CONVICTIONS PREVAIL, WHICH ARE
ALMOST OF A RELIGIOUS NATURE.

UNFORTUNATELY HE UNDERSTOOD ONLY VERY IMPERFECTLY HOW FEEBLE IS THE
FIGHTING SPIRIT OF THE SO-CALLED BOURGEOISIE. THAT WEAKNESS IS DUE TO
THEIR BUSINESS INTERESTS, WHICH INDIVIDUALS ARE TOO MUCH AFRAID OF
RISKING AND WHICH THEREFORE DETER THEM FROM TAKING ACTION. AND,
GENERALLY SPEAKING, A WELTANSCHAUUNG CAN HAVE NO PROSPECT OF SUCCESS
UNLESS THE BROAD MASSES DECLARE THEMSELVES READY TO ACT AS ITS
STANDARD-BEARERS AND TO FIGHT ON ITS BEHALF WHEREVER AND TO WHATEVER
EXTENT THAT MAY BE NECESSARY.

THIS FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LOWER STRATA OF THE
POPULATION RESULTED IN A VERY INADEQUATE CONCEPT OF THE SOCIAL PROBLEM.

IN ALL THIS DR. LUEGER WAS THE OPPOSITE OF SCHÃ¶NERER. HIS PROFOUND
KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE ENABLED HIM TO FORM A CORRECT ESTIMATE OF THE
VARIOUS SOCIAL FORCES AND IT SAVED HIM FROM UNDER-RATING THE POWER OF
EXISTING INSTITUTIONS. AND IT WAS PERHAPS THIS VERY QUALITY WHICH
ENABLED HIM TO UTILIZE THOSE INSTITUTIONS AS A MEANS TO SERVE THE
PURPOSES OF HIS POLICY.

HE SAW ONLY TOO CLEARLY THAT, IN OUR EPOCH, THE POLITICAL FIGHTING POWER
OF THE UPPER CLASSES IS QUITE INSIGNIFICANT AND NOT AT ALL CAPABLE OF
FIGHTING FOR A GREAT NEW MOVEMENT UNTIL THE TRIUMPH OF THAT MOVEMENT BE
SECURED. THUS HE DEVOTED THE GREATEST PART OF HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY TO
THE TASK OF WINNING OVER THOSE SECTIONS OF THE POPULATION WHOSE
EXISTENCE WAS IN DANGER AND FOSTERING THE MILITANT SPIRIT IN THEM RATHER
THAN ATTEMPTING TO PARALYSE IT. HE WAS ALSO QUICK TO ADOPT ALL AVAILABLE
MEANS FOR WINNING THE SUPPORT OF LONG-ESTABLISHED INSTITUTIONS, SO AS TO
BE ABLE TO DERIVE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE FOR HIS MOVEMENT FROM
THOSE OLD SOURCES OF POWER.

THUS IT WAS THAT, FIRST OF ALL, HE CHOSE AS THE SOCIAL BASIS OF HIS NEW
PARTY THAT MIDDLE CLASS WHICH WAS THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION. IN THIS
WAY HE SECURED A SOLID FOLLOWING WHICH WAS WILLING TO MAKE GREAT
SACRIFICES AND HAD GOOD FIGHTING STAMINA. HIS EXTREMELY WISE ATTITUDE
TOWARDS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH RAPIDLY WON OVER THE YOUNGER CLERGY IN SUCH
LARGE NUMBERS THAT THE OLD CLERICAL PARTY WAS FORCED TO RETIRE FROM THE
FIELD OF ACTION OR ELSE, WHICH WAS THE WISER COURSE, JOIN THE NEW PARTY,
IN THE HOPE OF GRADUALLY WINNING BACK ONE POSITION AFTER ANOTHER.

BUT IT WOULD BE A SERIOUS INJUSTICE TO THE MAN IF WE WERE TO REGARD THIS
AS HIS ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTIC. FOR HE POSSESSED THE QUALITIES OF AN
ABLE TACTICIAN, AND HAD THE TRUE GENIUS OF A GREAT REFORMER; BUT ALL
THESE WERE LIMITED BY HIS EXACT PERCEPTION OF THE POSSIBILITIES AT HAND
AND ALSO OF HIS OWN CAPABILITIES.

THE AIMS WHICH THIS REALLY EMINENT MAN DECIDED TO PURSUE WERE INTENSELY
PRACTICAL. HE WISHED TO CONQUER VIENNA, THE HEART OF THE MONARCHY. IT
WAS FROM VIENNA THAT THE LAST PULSES OF LIFE BEAT THROUGH THE DISEASED
AND WORN-OUT BODY OF THE DECREPIT EMPIRE. IF THE HEART COULD BE MADE
HEALTHIER THE OTHERS PARTS OF THE BODY WERE BOUND TO REVIVE. THAT IDEA
WAS CORRECT IN PRINCIPLE; BUT THE TIME WITHIN WHICH IT COULD BE APPLIED
IN PRACTICE WAS STRICTLY LIMITED. AND THAT WAS THE MAN'S WEAK POINT.

HIS ACHIEVEMENTS AS BURGOMASTER OF THE CITY OF VIENNA ARE IMMORTAL, IN
THE BEST SENSE OF THE WORD. BUT ALL THAT COULD NOT SAVE THE MONARCHY. IT
CAME TOO LATE.

HIS RIVAL, SCHÃ¶NERER, SAW THIS MORE CLEARLY. WHAT DR. LUEGER UNDERTOOK
TO PUT INTO PRACTICE TURNED OUT MARVELLOUSLY SUCCESSFUL. BUT THE RESULTS
WHICH HE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW THESE ACHIEVEMENTS DID NOT COME. SCHÃ¶NERER
DID NOT ATTAIN THE ENDS HE HAD PROPOSED TO HIMSELF; BUT HIS FEARS WERE
REALIZED, ALAS, IN A TERRIBLE FASHION. THUS BOTH THESE MEN FAILED TO
ATTAIN THEIR FURTHER OBJECTIVES. LUEGER COULD NOT SAVE AUSTRIA AND
SCHÃ¶NERER COULD NOT PREVENT THE DOWNFALL OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE IN
AUSTRIA.

TO STUDY THE CAUSES OF FAILURE IN THE CASE OF THESE TWO PARTIES IS TO
LEARN A LESSON THAT IS HIGHLY INSTRUCTIVE FOR OUR OWN EPOCH. THIS IS
SPECIALLY USEFUL FOR MY FRIENDS, BECAUSE IN MANY POINTS THE
CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR OWN DAY ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THAT TIME.
THEREFORE SUCH A LESSON MAY HELP US TO GUARD AGAINST THE MISTAKES WHICH
BROUGHT ONE OF THOSE MOVEMENTS TO AN END AND RENDERED THE OTHER BARREN
OF RESULTS.

IN MY OPINION, THE WRECK OF THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT IN AUSTRIA MUST BE
ATTRIBUTED TO THREE CAUSES.

THE FIRST OF THESE CONSISTED IN THE FACT THAT THE LEADERS DID NOT HAVE A
CLEAR CONCEPT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SOCIAL PROBLEM, PARTICULARLY FOR
A NEW MOVEMENT WHICH HAD AN ESSENTIALLY REVOLUTIONARY CHARACTER.
SCHÃ¶NERER AND HIS FOLLOWERS DIRECTED THEIR ATTENTION PRINCIPALLY TO THE
BOURGEOIS CLASSES. FOR THAT REASON THEIR MOVEMENT WAS BOUND TO TURN OUT
MEDIOCRE AND TAME. THE GERMAN BOURGEOISIE, ESPECIALLY IN ITS UPPER
CIRCLES, IS PACIFIST EVEN TO THE POINT OF COMPLETE
SELF-ABNEGATION--THOUGH THE INDIVIDUAL MAY NOT BE AWARE OF
THIS--WHEREVER THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THE NATION OR STATE ARE
CONCERNED. IN GOOD TIMES, WHICH IN THIS CASE MEANS TIMES OF GOOD
GOVERNMENT, SUCH A PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTITUDE MAKES THIS SOCIAL LAYER
EXTRAORDINARILY VALUABLE TO THE STATE. BUT WHEN THERE IS A BAD
GOVERNMENT, SUCH A QUALITY HAS A DESTRUCTIVE EFFECT. IN ORDER TO ASSURE
THE POSSIBILITY OF CARRYING THROUGH A REALLY STRENUOUS STRUGGLE, THE
PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT SHOULD HAVE DEVOTED ITS EFFORTS TO WINNING OVER THE
MASSES. THE FAILURE TO DO THIS LEFT THE MOVEMENT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
WITHOUT THE ELEMENTARY IMPULSE WHICH SUCH A WAVE NEEDS IF IT IS NOT TO
EBB WITHIN A SHORT WHILE.

IN FAILING TO SEE THE TRUTH OF THIS PRINCIPLE CLEARLY AT THE VERY OUTSET
OF THE MOVEMENT AND IN NEGLECTING TO PUT IT INTO PRACTICE THE NEW PARTY
MADE AN INITIAL MISTAKE WHICH COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE RECTIFIED
AFTERWARDS. FOR THE NUMEROUS MODERATE BOURGEOIS ELEMENTS ADMITTED INTO
THE MOVEMENTS INCREASINGLY DETERMINED ITS INTERNAL ORIENTATION AND THUS
FORESTALLED ALL FURTHER PROSPECTS OF GAINING ANY APPRECIABLE SUPPORT
AMONG THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE. UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS SUCH A MOVEMENT
COULD NOT GET BEYOND MERE DISCUSSION AND CRITICISM. QUASI-RELIGIOUS
FAITH AND THE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE WERE NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE MOVEMENT
ANY MORE. THEIR PLACE WAS TAKEN BY THE EFFORT TOWARDS 'POSITIVE'
COLLABORATION, WHICH IN THIS CASE MEANT THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE
EXISTING STATE OF AFFAIRS, GRADUALLY WHITTLING AWAY THE ROUGH CORNERS OF
THE QUESTIONS IN DISPUTE, AND ENDING UP WITH THE MAKING OF A
DISHONOURABLE PEACE.

SUCH WAS THE FATE OF THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT, BECAUSE AT THE START THE
LEADERS DID NOT REALIZE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT CONDITION OF SUCCESS WAS
THAT THEY SHOULD RECRUIT THEIR FOLLOWING FROM THE BROAD MASSES OF THE
PEOPLE. THE MOVEMENT THUS BECAME BOURGEOIS AND RESPECTABLE AND RADICAL
ONLY IN MODERATION.

FROM THIS FAILURE RESULTED THE SECOND CAUSE OF ITS RAPID DECLINE.

THE POSITION OF THE GERMANS IN AUSTRIA WAS ALREADY DESPERATE WHEN
PAN-GERMANISM AROSE. YEAR AFTER YEAR PARLIAMENT WAS BEING USED MORE AND
MORE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE GRADUAL EXTINCTION OF THE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN
POPULATION. THE ONLY HOPE FOR ANY ELEVENTH-HOUR EFFORT TO SAVE IT LAY IN
THE OVERTHROW OF THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM; BUT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE
PROSPECT OF THIS HAPPENING.

THEREWITH THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT WAS CONFRONTED WITH A QUESTION OF
PRIMARY IMPORTANCE.

TO OVERTHROW THE PARLIAMENT, SHOULD THE PAN-GERMANISTS HAVE ENTERED IT
'TO UNDERMINE IT FROM WITHIN', AS THE CURRENT PHRASE WAS? OR SHOULD THEY
HAVE ASSAILED THE INSTITUTION AS SUCH FROM THE OUTSIDE?

THEY ENTERED THE PARLIAMENT AND CAME OUT DEFEATED. BUT THEY HAD FOUND
THEMSELVES OBLIGED TO ENTER.

FOR IN ORDER TO WAGE AN EFFECTIVE WAR AGAINST SUCH A POWER FROM THE
OUTSIDE, INDOMITABLE COURAGE AND A READY SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE WERE
NECESSARY WEAPONS. IN SUCH CASES THE BULL MUST BE SEIZED BY THE HORNS.
FURIOUS DRIVES MAY BRING THE ASSAILANT TO THE GROUND AGAIN AND AGAIN;
BUT IF HE HAS A STOUT HEART HE WILL STAND UP, EVEN THOUGH SOME BONES MAY
BE BROKEN, AND ONLY AFTER A LONG AND TOUGH STRUGGLE WILL HE ACHIEVE HIS
TRIUMPH. NEW CHAMPIONS ARE ATTRACTED TO A CAUSE BY THE APPEAL OF GREAT
SACRIFICES MADE FOR ITS SAKE, UNTIL THAT INDOMITABLE SPIRIT IS FINALLY
CROWNED WITH SUCCESS.

FOR SUCH A RESULT, HOWEVER, THE CHILDREN OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE GREAT
MASSES ARE NECESSARY. THEY ALONE HAVE THE REQUISITE DETERMINATION AND
TENACITY TO FIGHT A SANGUINARY ISSUE THROUGH TO THE END. BUT THE
PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT DID NOT HAVE THESE BROAD MASSES AS ITS CHAMPIONS,
AND SO NO OTHER MEANS OF SOLUTION COULD BE TRIED OUT EXCEPT THAT OF
ENTERING PARLIAMCNT.

IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO THINK THAT THIS DECISION RESULTED FROM A LONG
SERIES OF INTERNAL HESITATIONS OF A MORAL KIND, OR THAT IT WAS THE
OUTCOME OF CAREFUL CALCULATION. NO. THEY DID NOT EVEN THINK OF ANOTHER
SOLUTION. THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THIS BLUNDER WERE ACTUATED BY
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS AND VAGUE NOTIONS AS TO WHAT WOULD BE THE
SIGNIFICANCE AND EFFECT OF TAKING PART IN SUCH A SPECIAL WAY IN THAT
INSTITUTION WHICH THEY HAD CONDEMNED ON PRINCIPLE. IN GENERAL THEY HOPED
THAT THEY WOULD THUS HAVE THE MEANS OF EXPOUNDING THEIR CAUSE TO THE
GREAT MASSES OF THE PEOPLE, BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEAK BEFORE
'THE FORUM OF THE WHOLE NATION'. ALSO, IT SEEMED REASONABLE TO BELIEVE
THAT BY ATTACKING THE EVIL IN THE ROOT THEY WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN
IF THE ATTACK CAME FROM OUTSIDE. THEY BELIEVED THAT, IF PROTECTED BY THE
IMMUNITY OF PARLIAMENT, THE POSITION OF THE INDIVIDUAL PROTAGONISTS
WOULD BE STRENGTHENED AND THAT THUS THE FORCE OF THEIR ATTACKS WOULD BE
ENHANCED.

IN REALITY EVERYTHING TURNED OUT QUITE OTHERWISE.

THE FORUM BEFORE WHICH THE PAN-GERMAN REPRESENTATIVES SPOKE HAD NOT
GROWN GREATER, BUT HAD ACTUALLY BECOME SMALLER; FOR EACH SPOKE ONLY TO
THE CIRCLE THAT WAS READY TO LISTEN TO HIM OR COULD READ THE REPORT OF
HIS SPEECH IN THE NEWSPAPERS.

BUT THE GREATER FORUM OF IMMEDIATE LISTENERS IS NOT THE PARLIAMENTARY
AUDITORIUM: IT IS THE LARGE PUBLIC MEETING. FOR HERE ALONE WILL THERE BE
THOUSANDS OF MEN WHO HAVE COME SIMPLY TO HEAR WHAT A SPEAKER HAS TO SAY,
WHEREAS IN THE PARLIAMENTARY SITTINGS ONLY A FEW HUNDRED ARE PRESENT;
AND FOR THE MOST PART THESE ARE THERE ONLY TO EARN THEIR DAILY ALLOWANCE
FOR ATTENDANCE AND NOT TO BE ENLIGHTENED BY THE WISDOM OF ONE OR OTHER
OF THE 'REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE'.

THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IS THAT THE SAME PUBLIC IS ALWAYS
PRESENT AND THAT THIS PUBLIC DOES NOT WISH TO LEARN ANYTHING NEW;
BECAUSE, SETTING ASIDE THE QUESTION OF ITS INTELLIGENCE, IT LACKS EVEN
THAT MODEST QUANTUM OF WILL-POWER WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE EFFORT OF
LEARNING.

NOT ONE OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE WILL PAY HOMAGE TO A
SUPERIOR TRUTH AND DEVOTE HIMSELF TO ITS SERVICE. NO. NOT ONE OF THESE
GENTRY WILL ACT THUS, EXCEPT HE HAS GROUNDS FOR HOPING THAT BY SUCH A
CONVERSION HE MAY BE ABLE TO RETAIN THE REPRESENTATION OF HIS
CONSTITUENCY IN THE COMING LEGISLATURE. THEREFORE, ONLY WHEN IT BECOMES
QUITE CLEAR THAT THE OLD PARTY IS LIKELY TO HAVE A BAD TIME OF IT AT THE
FORTHCOMING ELECTIONS--ONLY THEN WILL THOSE MODELS OF MANLY VIRTUE SET
OUT IN SEARCH OF A NEW PARTY OR A NEW POLICY WHICH MAY HAVE BETTER
ELECTORAL PROSPECTS; BUT OF COURSE THIS CHANGE OF POSITION WILL BE
ACCOMPANIED BY A VERITABLE DELUGE OF HIGH MORAL MOTIVES TO JUSTIFY IT.
AND THUS IT ALWAYS HAPPENS THAT WHEN AN EXISTING PARTY HAS INCURRED SUCH
GENERAL DISFAVOUR AMONG THE PUBLIC THAT IT IS THREATENED WITH THE
PROBABILITY OF A CRUSHING DEFEAT, THEN A GREAT MIGRATION COMMENCES. THE
PARLIAMENTARY RATS LEAVE THE PARTY SHIP.

ALL THIS HAPPENS NOT BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE CASE HAVE BECOME
BETTER INFORMED ON THE QUESTIONS AT ISSUE AND HAVE RESOLVED TO ACT
ACCORDINGLY. THESE CHANGES OF FRONT ARE EVIDENCE ONLY OF THAT GIFT OF
CLAIRVOYANCE WHICH WARNS THE PARLIAMENTARY FLEA AT THE RIGHT MOMENT AND
ENABLES HIM TO HOP INTO ANOTHER WARM PARTY BED.

TO SPEAK BEFORE SUCH A FORUM SIGNIFIES CASTING PEARLS BEFORE CERTAIN
ANIMALS.

VERILY IT DOES NOT REPAY THE PAINS TAKEN; FOR THE RESULT MUST ALWAYS BE
NEGATIVE.

AND THAT IS ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED. THE PAN-GERMAN REPRESENTATIVES MIGHT
HAVE TALKED THEMSELVES HOARSE, BUT TO NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER.

THE PRESS EITHER IGNORED THEM TOTALLY OR SO MUTILATED THEIR SPEECHES
THAT THE LOGICAL CONSISTENCY WAS DESTROYED OR THE MEANING TWISTED ROUND
IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE PUBLIC GOT ONLY A VERY WRONG IMPRESSION REGARDING
THE AIMS OF THE NEW MOVEMENT. WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS SAID WAS NOT
OF IMPORTANCE. THE IMPORTANT MATTER WAS WHAT PEOPLE READ AS COMING FROM
THEM. THIS CONSISTED OF MERE EXTRACTS WHICH HAD BEEN TORN OUT OF THE
CONTEXT OF THE SPEECHES AND GAVE AN IMPRESSION OF INCOHERENT NONSENSE,
WHICH INDEED WAS PURPOSELY MEANT. THUS THE ONLY PUBLIC BEFORE WHICH THEY
REALLY SPOKE CONSISTED MERELY OF FIVE HUNDRED PARLIAMENTARIANS; AND THAT
SAYS ENOUGH.

THE WORST WAS THE FOLLOWING:

THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT COULD HOPE FOR SUCCESS ONLY IF THE LEADERS
REALIZED FROM THE VERY FIRST MOMENT THAT HERE THERE WAS NO QUESTION SO
MUCH OF A NEW PARTY AS OF A NEW WELTANSCHAUUNG. THIS ALONE COULD AROUSE
THE INNER MORAL FORCES THAT WERE NECESSARY FOR SUCH A GIGANTIC STRUGGLE.
AND FOR THIS STRUGGLE THE LEADERS MUST BE MEN OF FIRST-CLASS BRAINS AND
INDOMITABLE COURAGE. IF THE STRUGGLE ON BEHALF OF A WELTANSCHAUUNG IS
NOT CONDUCTED BY MEN OF HEROIC SPIRIT WHO ARE READY TO SACRIFICE,
EVERYTHING, WITHIN A SHORT WHILE IT WILL BECOME IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND REAL
FIGHTING FOLLOWERS WHO ARE READY TO LAY DOWN THEIR LIVES FOR THE CAUSE.
A MAN WHO FIGHTS ONLY FOR HIS OWN EXISTENCE HAS NOT MUCH LEFT OVER FOR
THE SERVICE OF THE COMMUNITY.

IN ORDER TO SECURE THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS,
EVERYBODY CONCERNED MUST BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEW MOVEMENT
LOOKS TO POSTERITY FOR ITS HONOUR AND GLORY BUT THAT IT HAS NO
RECOMPENSE TO OFFER TO THE PRESENT-DAY MEMBERS. IF A MOVEMENT SHOULD
OFFER A LARGE NUMBER OF POSITIONS AND OFFICES THAT ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE
THE NUMBER OF UNWORTHY CANDIDATES ADMITTED TO MEMBERSHIP WILL BE
CONSTANTLY ON THE INCREASE AND EVENTUALLY A DAY WILL COME WHEN THERE
WILL BE SUCH A PREPONDERANCE OF POLITICAL PROFITEERS AMONG THE
MEMBERSHIP OF A SUCCESSFUL PARTY THAT THE COMBATANTS WHO BORE THE BRUNT
OF THE BATTLE IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF THE MOVEMENT CAN NOW SCARCELY
RECOGNIZE THEIR OWN PARTY AND MAY BE EJECTED BY THE LATER ARRIVALS AS
UNWANTED BALLAST. THEREWITH THE MOVEMENT WILL NO LONGER HAVE A MISSION
TO FULFIL.

ONCE THE PAN-GERMANISTS DECIDED TO COLLABORATE WITH PARLIAMENT THEY WERE
NO LONGER LEADERS AND COMBATANTS IN A POPULAR MOVEMENT, BUT MERELY
PARLIAMENTARIANS. THUS THE MOVEMENT SANK TO THE COMMON POLITICAL PARTY
LEVEL OF THE DAY AND NO LONGER HAD THE STRENGTH TO FACE A HOSTILE FATE
AND DEFY THE RISK OF MARTYRDOM. INSTEAD OF FIGHTING, THE PAN-GERMAN
LEADERS FELL INTO THE HABIT OF TALKING AND NEGOTIATING. THE NEW
PARLIAMENTARIANS SOON FOUND THAT IT WAS A MORE SATISFACTORY, BECAUSE
LESS RISKY, WAY OF FULFILLING THEIR TASK IF THEY WOULD DEFEND THE NEW
WELTANSCHAUUNG WITH THE SPIRITUAL WEAPON OF PARLIAMENTARY RHETORIC
RATHER THAN TAKE UP A FIGHT IN WHICH THEY PLACED THEIR LIVES IN DANGER,
THE OUTCOME OF WHICH ALSO WAS UNCERTAIN AND EVEN AT THE BEST COULD OFFER
NO PROSPECT OF PERSONAL GAIN FOR THEMSELVES.

WHEN THEY HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS IN PARLIAMENT THEIR ADHERENTS OUTSIDE
HOPED AND WAITED FOR MIRACLES TO HAPPEN. NATURALLY NO SUCH MIRACLES
HAPPENED OR COULD HAPPEN. WHEREUPON THE ADHERENTS OF THE MOVEMENT SOON
GREW IMPATIENT, BECAUSE REPORTS THEY READ ABOUT THEIR OWN DEPUTIES DID
NOT IN THE LEAST COME UP TO WHAT HAD BEEN EXPECTED WHEN THEY VOTED FOR
THESE DEPUTIES AT THE ELECTIONS. THE REASON FOR THIS WAS NOT FAR TO
SEEK. IT WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT AN UNFRIENDLY PRESS REFRAINED FROM
GIVING A TRUE ACCOUNT OF WHAT THE PAN-GERMAN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE
PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY DOING.

ACCORDING AS THE NEW DEPUTIES GOT TO LIKE THIS MILD FORM OF
'REVOLUTIONARY' STRUGGLE IN PARLIAMENT AND IN THE PROVINCIAL DIETS THEY
GRADUALLY BECAME RELUCTANT TO RESUME THE MORE HAZARDOUS WORK OF
EXPOUNDING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE MOVEMENT BEFORE THE BROAD MASSES OF THE
PEOPLE.

MASS MEETINGS IN PUBLIC BECAME MORE AND MORE RARE, THOUGH THESE ARE THE
ONLY MEANS OF EXERCISING A REALLY EFFECTIVE INFLUENCE ON THE PEOPLE;
BECAUSE HERE THE INFLUENCE COMES FROM DIRECT PERSONAL CONTACT AND IN
THIS WAY THE SUPPORT OF LARGE SECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE CAN BE OBTAINED.

WHEN THE TABLES ON WHICH THE SPEAKERS USED TO STAND IN THE GREAT
BEER-HALLS, ADDRESSING AN ASSEMBLY OF THOUSANDS, WERE DESERTED FOR THE
PARLIAMENTARY TRIBUNE AND THE SPEECHES WERE NO LONGER ADDRESSED TO THE
PEOPLE DIRECTLY BUT TO THE SO-CALLED 'CHOSEN' REPRESENTATIVES, THE
PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT LOST ITS POPULAR CHARACTER AND IN A LITTLE WHILE
DEGENERATED TO THE LEVEL OF A MORE OR LESS SERIOUS CLUB WHERE PROBLEMS
OF THE DAY ARE DISCUSSED ACADEMICALLY.

THE WRONG IMPRESSION CREATED BY THE PRESS WAS NO LONGER CORRECTED BY
PERSONAL CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE THROUGH PUBLIC MEETINGS, WHEREBY THE
INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTATIVES MIGHT HAVE GIVEN A TRUE ACCOUNT OF THEIR
ACTIVITIES. THE FINAL RESULT OF THIS NEGLECT WAS THAT THE WORD
'PAN-GERMAN' CAME TO HAVE AN UNPLEASANT SOUND IN THE EARS OF THE MASSES.

THE KNIGHTS OF THE PEN AND THE LITERARY SNOBS OF TO-DAY SHOULD BE MADE
TO REALIZE THAT THE GREAT TRANSFORMATIONS WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THIS
WORLD WERE NEVER CONDUCTED BY A GOOSEQUILL. NO. THE TASK OF THE PEN MUST
ALWAYS BE THAT OF PRESENTING THE THEORETICAL CONCEPTS WHICH MOTIVATE
SUCH CHANGES. THE FORCE WHICH HAS EVER AND ALWAYS SET IN MOTION GREAT
HISTORICAL AVALANCHES OF RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IS THE MAGIC
POWER OF THE SPOKEN WORD.

THE BROAD MASSES OF A POPULATION ARE MORE AMENABLE TO THE APPEAL OF
RHETORIC THAN TO ANY OTHER FORCE. ALL GREAT MOVEMENTS ARE POPULAR
MOVEMENTS. THEY ARE THE VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS OF HUMAN PASSIONS AND
EMOTIONS, STIRRED INTO ACTIVITY BY THE RUTHLESS GODDESS OF DISTRESS OR
BY THE TORCH OF THE SPOKEN WORD CAST INTO THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLE. IN NO
CASE HAVE GREAT MOVEMENTS BEEN SET AFOOT BY THE SYRUPY EFFUSIONS OF
AESTHETIC LITTÃ©RATEURS AND DRAWING-ROOM HEROES.

THE DOOM OF A NATION CAN BE AVERTED ONLY BY A STORM OF GLOWING PASSION;
BUT ONLY THOSE WHO ARE PASSIONATE THEMSELVES CAN AROUSE PASSION IN
OTHERS. IT IS ONLY THROUGH THE CAPACITY FOR PASSIONATE FEELING THAT
CHOSEN LEADERS CAN WIELD THE POWER OF THE WORD WHICH, LIKE HAMMER BLOWS,
WILL OPEN THE DOOR TO THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE.

HE WHO IS NOT CAPABLE OF PASSIONATE FEELING AND SPEECH WAS NEVER CHOSEN
BY PROVIDENCE TO BE THE HERALD OF ITS WILL. THEREFORE A WRITER SHOULD
STICK TO HIS INK-BOTTLE AND BUSY HIMSELF WITH THEORETICAL QUESTIONS IF
HE HAS THE REQUISITE ABILITY AND KNOWLEDGE. HE HAS NOT BEEN BORN OR
CHOSEN TO BE A LEADER.

A MOVEMENT WHICH HAS GREAT ENDS TO ACHIEVE MUST CAREFULLY GUARD AGAINST
THE DANGER OF LOSING CONTACT WITH THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE. EVERY
PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED MUST BE EXAMINED FROM THIS VIEWPOINT FIRST OF ALL
AND THE DECISION TO BE MADE MUST ALWAYS BE IN HARMONY WITH THIS
PRINCIPLE.

THE MOVEMENT MUST AVOID EVERYTHING WHICH MIGHT LESSEN OR WEAK
ONE CAN IMAGINE WHAT KIND OF THOUGHTS SUCH A PROSPECT AWAKENED IN THE
MIND OF A YOUNG FELLOW WHO WAS BY NO MEANS WHAT IS CALLED A 'GOOD BOY'
IN THE CURRENT SENSE OF THAT TERM. THE RIDICULOUSLY EASY SCHOOL TASKS
WHICH WE WERE GIVEN MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO SPEND FAR MORE TIME IN
THE OPEN AIR THAN AT HOME. TO-DAY, WHEN MY POLITICAL OPPONENTS PRY INTO
MY LIFE WITH DILIGENT SCRUTINY, AS FAR BACK AS THE DAYS OF MY BOYHOOD,
SO AS FINALLY TO BE ABLE TO PROVE WHAT DISREPUTABLE TRICKS THIS HITLER
WAS ACCUSTOMED TO IN HIS YOUNG DAYS, I THANK HEAVEN THAT I CAN LOOK BACK
TO THOSE HAPPY DAYS AND FIND THE MEMORY OF THEM HELPFUL. THE FIELDS AND
THE WOODS WERE THEN THE TERRAIN ON WHICH ALL DISPUTES WERE FOUGHT OUT.

EVEN ATTENDANCE AT THE REALSCHULE COULD NOT ALTER MY WAY OF SPENDING MY
TIME. BUT I HAD NOW ANOTHER BATTLE TO FIGHT.

SO LONG AS THE PATERNAL PLAN TO MAKE A STATE FUNCTIONARY CONTRADICTED MY
OWN INCLINATIONS ONLY IN THE ABSTRACT, THE CONFLICT WAS EASY TO BEAR. I
COULD BE DISCREET ABOUT EXPRESSING MY PERSONAL VIEWS AND THUS AVOID
CONSTANTLY RECURRENT DISPUTES. MY OWN RESOLUTION NOT TO BECOME A
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE TIME BEING TO PUT MY MIND
COMPLETELY AT REST. I HELD ON TO THAT RESOLUTION INEXORABLY. BUT THE
SITUATION BECAME MORE DIFFICULT ONCE I HAD A POSITIVE PLAN OF MY OWN
WHICH I MIGHT PRESENT TO MY FATHER AS A COUNTER-SUGGESTION. THIS
HAPPENED WHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD. HOW IT CAME ABOUT I CANNOT EXACTLY
SAY NOW; BUT ONE DAY IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT I WOULD BE A PAINTER--I
MEAN AN ARTIST. THAT I HAD AN APTITUDE FOR DRAWING WAS AN ADMITTED FACT.
IT WAS EVEN ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MY FATHER HAD SENT ME TO THE
REALSCHULE; BUT HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF HAVING THAT TALENT DEVELOPED IN
SUCH A WAY THAT I COULD TAKE UP PAINTING AS A PROFESSIONAL CAREER. QUITE
THE CONTRARY. WHEN, AS A RESULT OF MY RENEWED REFUSAL TO ADOPT HIS
FAVOURITE PLAN, MY FATHER ASKED ME FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT I MYSELF
REALLY WISHED TO BE, THE RESOLUTION THAT I HAD ALREADY FORMED EXPRESSED
ITSELF ALMOST AUTOMATICALLY. FOR A WHILE MY FATHER WAS SPEECHLESS. "A
PAINTER? AN ARTIST-PAINTER?" HE EXCLAIMED.

HE WONDERED WHETHER I WAS IN A SOUND STATE OF MIND. HE THOUGHT THAT HE
MIGHT NOT HAVE CAUGHT MY WORDS RIGHTLY, OR THAT HE HAD MISUNDERSTOOD
WHAT I MEANT. BUT WHEN I HAD EXPLAINED MY IDEAS TO HIM AND HE SAW HOW
SERIOUSLY I TOOK THEM, HE OPPOSED THEM WITH THAT FULL DETERMINATION
WHICH WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM. HIS DECISION WAS EXCEEDINGLY SIMPLE AND
COULD NOT BE DEFLECTED FROM ITS COURSE BY ANY CONSIDERATION OF WHAT MY
OWN NATURAL QUALIFICATIONS REALLY WERE.

"ARTIST! NOT AS LONG AS I LIVE, NEVER." AS THE SON HAD INHERITED SOME OF
THE FATHER'S OBSTINACY, BESIDES HAVING OTHER QUALITIES OF HIS OWN, MY
REPLY WAS EQUALLY ENERGETIC. BUT IT STATED SOMETHING QUITE THE CONTRARY.

AT THAT OUR STRUGGLE BECAME STALEMATE. THE FATHER WOULD NOT ABANDON HIS
'NEVER', AND I BECAME ALL THE MORE CONSOLIDATED IN MY 'NEVERTHELESS'.

NATURALLY THE RESULTING SITUATION WAS NOT PLEASANT. THE OLD GENTLEMAN
WAS BITTERLY ANNOYED; AND INDEED SO WAS I, ALTHOUGH I REALLY LOVED HIM.
MY FATHER FORBADE ME TO ENTERTAIN ANY HOPES OF TAKING UP THE ART OF
PAINTING AS A PROFESSION. I WENT A STEP FURTHER AND DECLARED THAT I
WOULD NOT STUDY ANYTHING ELSE. WITH SUCH DECLARATIONS THE SITUATION
BECAME STILL MORE STRAINED, SO THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN IRREVOCABLY
DECIDED TO ASSERT HIS PARENTAL AUTHORITY AT ALL COSTS. THAT LED ME TO
ADOPT AN ATTITUDE OF CIRCUMSPECT SILENCE, BUT I PUT MY THREAT INTO
EXECUTION. I THOUGHT THAT, ONCE IT BECAME CLEAR TO MY FATHER THAT I WAS
MAKING NO PROGRESS AT THE REALSCHULE, FOR WEAL OR FOR WOE, HE WOULD BE
FORCED TO ALLOW ME TO FOLLOW THE HAPPY CAREER I HAD DREAMED OF.

I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I CALCULATED RIGHTLY OR NOT. CERTAINLY MY FAILURE
TO MAKE PROGRESS BECAME QUITE VISIBLE IN THE SCHOOL. I STUDIED JUST THE
SUBJECTS THAT APPEALED TO ME, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH I THOUGHT MIGHT BE
OF ADVANTAGE TO ME LATER ON AS A PAINTER. WHAT DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE
ANY IMPORTANCE FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW, OR WHAT DID NOT OTHERWISE APPEAL
TO ME FAVOURABLY, I COMPLETELY SABOTAGED. MY SCHOOL REPORTS OF THAT TIME
WERE ALWAYS IN THE EXTREMES OF GOOD OR BAD, ACCORDING TO THE SUBJECT AND
THE INTEREST IT HAD FOR ME. IN ONE COLUMN MY QUALIFICATION READ 'VERY
GOOD' OR 'EXCELLENT'. IN ANOTHER IT READ 'AVERAGE' OR EVEN 'BELOW
AVERAGE'. BY FAR MY BEST SUBJECTS WERE GEOGRAPHY AND, EVEN MORE SO,
GENERAL HISTORY. THESE WERE MY TWO FAVOURITE SUBJECTS, AND I LED THE
CLASS IN THEM.

WHEN I LOOK BACK OVER SO MANY YEARS AND TRY TO JUDGE THE RESULTS OF THAT
EXPERIENCE I FIND TWO VERY SIGNIFICANT FACTS STANDING OUT CLEARLY BEFORE
MY MIND.

FIRST, I BECAME A NATIONALIST.

SECOND, I LEARNED TO UNDERSTAND AND GRASP THE TRUE MEANING OF HISTORY.

THE OLD AUSTRIA WAS A MULTI-NATIONAL STATE. IN THOSE DAYS AT LEAST THE
CITIZENS OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE, TAKEN THROUGH AND THROUGH, COULD NOT
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT FACT MEANT IN THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF THE INDIVIDUALS
WITHIN SUCH A STATE. AFTER THE MAGNIFICENT TRIUMPHANT MARCH OF THE
VICTORIOUS ARMIES IN THE FRANCO-GERMAN WAR THE GERMANS IN THE REICH
BECAME STEADILY MORE AND MORE ESTRANGED FROM THE GERMANS BEYOND THEIR
FRONTIERS, PARTLY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT DEIGN TO APPRECIATE THOSE OTHER
GERMANS AT THEIR TRUE VALUE OR SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE INCAPABLE OF
DOING SO.

THE GERMANS OF THE REICH DID NOT REALIZE THAT IF THE GERMANS IN AUSTRIA
HAD NOT BEEN OF THE BEST RACIAL STOCK THEY COULD NEVER HAVE GIVEN THE
STAMP OF THEIR OWN CHARACTER TO AN EMPIRE OF 52 MILLIONS, SO DEFINITELY
THAT IN GERMANY ITSELF THE IDEA AROSE--THOUGH QUITE AN ERRONEOUS
ONE--THAT AUSTRIA WAS A GERMAN STATE. THAT WAS AN ERROR WHICH LED TO
DIRE CONSEQUENCES; BUT ALL THE SAME IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT TESTIMONY TO
THE CHARACTER OF THE TEN MILLION GERMANS IN THAT EAST MARK. (NOTE 3)
ONLY VERY FEW OF THE GERMANS IN THE REICH ITSELF HAD AN IDEA OF THE BITTER
STRUGGLE WHICH THOSE EASTERN GERMANS HAD TO CARRY ON DAILY FOR THE
PRESERVATION OF THEIR GERMAN LANGUAGE, THEIR GERMAN SCHOOLS AND THEIR
GERMAN CHARACTER. ONLY TO-DAY, WHEN A TRAGIC FATE HAS TORN SEVERAL
MILLIONS OF OUR KINSFOLK AWAY FROM THE REICH AND HAS FORCED THEM TO LIVE
UNDER THE RULE OF THE STRANGER, DREAMING OF THAT COMMON FATHERLAND
TOWARDS WHICH ALL THEIR YEARNINGS ARE DIRECTED AND STRUGGLING TO UPHOLD
AT LEAST THE SACRED RIGHT OF USING THEIR MOTHER TONGUE--ONLY NOW HAVE
THE WIDER CIRCLES OF THE GERMAN POPULATION COME TO REALIZE WHAT IT MEANS
TO HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THE TRADITIONS OF ONE'S RACE. AND SO AT LAST
PERHAPS THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE AND THERE WHO CAN ASSESS THE GREATNESS OF
THAT GERMAN SPIRIT WHICH ANIMATED THE OLD EAST MARK AND ENABLED THOSE
PEOPLE, LEFT ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THEIR OWN RESOURCES, TO DEFEND THE
EMPIRE AGAINST THE ORIENT FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO HOLD
FAST THE FRONTIERS OF THE GERMAN LANGUAGE THROUGH A GUERILLA WARFARE OF
ATTRITION, AT A TIME WHEN THE GERMAN EMPIRE WAS SEDULOUSLY CULTIVATING
AN INTEREST FOR COLONIES BUT NOT FOR ITS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD BEFORE THE
THRESHOLD OF ITS OWN DOOR.

[NOTE 3. SEE TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION.]

WHAT HAS HAPPENED ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE, IN EVERY KIND OF STRUGGLE,
HAPPENED ALSO IN THE LANGUAGE FIGHT WHICH WAS CARRIED ON IN THE OLD
AUSTRIA. THERE WERE THREE GROUPS--THE FIGHTERS, THE HEDGERS AND THE
TRAITORS. EVEN IN THE SCHOOLS THIS SIFTING ALREADY BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE.
AND IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE STRUGGLE FOR THE LANGUAGE WAS WAGED
PERHAPS IN ITS BITTEREST FORM AROUND THE SCHOOL; BECAUSE THIS WAS THE
NURSERY WHERE THE SEEDS HAD TO BE WATERED WHICH WERE TO SPRING UP AND
FORM THE FUTURE GENERATION. THE TACTICAL OBJECTIVE OF THE FIGHT WAS THE
WINNING OVER OF THE CHILD, AND IT WAS TO THE CHILD THAT THE FIRST
RALLYING CRY WAS ADDRESSED:

"GERMAN YOUTH, DO NOT FORGET THAT YOU ARE A GERMAN," AND "REMEMBER,
LITTLE GIRL, THAT ONE DAY YOU MUST BE A GERMAN MOTHER."

THOSE WHO KNOW SOMETHING OF THE JUVENILE SPIRIT CAN UNDERSTAND HOW YOUTH
WILL ALWAYS LEND A GLAD EAR TO SUCH A RALLYING CRY. UNDER MANY FORMS THE
YOUNG PEOPLE LED THE STRUGGLE, FIGHTING IN THEIR OWN WAY AND WITH THEIR
OWN WEAPONS. THEY REFUSED TO SING NON-GERMAN SONGS. THE GREATER THE
EFFORTS MADE TO WIN THEM AWAY FROM THEIR GERMAN ALLEGIANCE, THE MORE
THEY EXALTED THE GLORY OF THEIR GERMAN HEROES. THEY STINTED THEMSELVES
IN BUYING THINGS TO EAT, SO THAT THEY MIGHT SPARE THEIR PENNIES TO HELP
THE WAR CHEST OF THEIR ELDERS. THEY WERE INCREDIBLY ALERT IN THE
SIGNIFICANCE OF WHAT THE NON-GERMAN TEACHERS SAID AND THEY CONTRADICTED
IN UNISON. THEY WORE THE FORBIDDEN EMBLEMS OF THEIR OWN KINSFOLK AND
WERE HAPPY WHEN PENALISED FOR DOING SO, OR EVEN PHYSICALLY PUNISHED. IN
MINIATURE THEY WERE MIRRORS OF LOYALTY FROM WHICH THE OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT
LEARN A LESSON.

AND THUS IT WAS THAT AT A COMPARATIVELY EARLY AGE I TOOK PART IN THE
STRUGGLE WHICH THE NATIONALITIES WERE WAGING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN THE
OLD AUSTRIA. WHEN MEETINGS WERE HELD FOR THE SOUTH MARK GERMAN LEAGUE
AND THE SCHOOL LEAGUE WE WORE CORNFLOWERS AND BLACK-RED-GOLD COLOURS TO
EXPRESS OUR LOYALTY. WE GREETED ONE ANOTHER WITH HEIL! AND INSTEAD OF
THE AUSTRIAN ANTHEM WE SANG OUR OWN DEUTSCHLAND ÃœBER ALLES, DESPITE
WARNINGS AND PENALTIES. THUS THE YOUTH WERE EDUCATED POLITICALLY AT A
TIME WHEN THE CITIZENS OF A SO-CALLED NATIONAL STATE FOR THE MOST PART
KNEW LITTLE OF THEIR OWN NATIONALITY EXCEPT THE LANGUAGE. OF COURSE, I
DID NOT BELONG TO THE HEDGERS. WITHIN A LITTLE WHILE I HAD BECOME AN
ARDENT 'GERMAN NATIONAL', WHICH HAS A DIFFERENT MEANING FROM THE PARTY
SIGNIFICANCE ATTACHED TO THAT PHRASE TO-DAY.

I DEVELOPED VERY RAPIDLY IN THE NATIONALIST DIRECTION, AND BY THE TIME I
WAS 15 YEARS OLD I HAD COME TO UNDERSTAND THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN
DYNASTIC PATRIOTISM AND NATIONALISM BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF FOLK, OR
PEOPLE, MY INCLINATION BEING ENTIRELY IN FAVOUR OF THE LATTER.

SUCH A PREFERENCE MAY NOT PERHAPS BE CLEARLY INTELLIGIBLE TO THOSE WHO
HAVE NEVER TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO STUDY THE INTERNAL CONDITIONS THAT
PREVAILED UNDER THE HABSBURG MONARCHY.

AMONG HISTORICAL STUDIES UNIVERSAL HISTORY WAS THE SUBJECT ALMOST
EXCLUSIVELY TAUGHT IN THE AUSTRIAN SCHOOLS, FOR OF SPECIFIC AUSTRIAN
HISTORY THERE WAS ONLY VERY LITTLE. THE FATE OF THIS STATE WAS CLOSELY
BOUND UP WITH THE EXISTENCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF GERMANY AS A WHOLE; SO A
DIVISION OF HISTORY INTO GERMAN HISTORY AND AUSTRIAN HISTORY WOULD BE
PRACTICALLY INCONCEIVABLE. AND INDEED IT WAS ONLY WHEN THE GERMAN PEOPLE
CAME TO BE DIVIDED BETWEEN TWO STATES THAT THIS DIVISION OF GERMAN
HISTORY BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE.

THE INSIGNIA (NOTE 4) OF A FORMER IMPERIAL SOVEREIGNTY WHICH WERE STILL
PRESERVED IN VIENNA APPEARED TO ACT AS MAGICAL RELICS RATHER THAN AS THE
VISIBLE GUARANTEE OF AN EVERLASTING BOND OF UNION.

[NOTE 4. WHEN FRANCIS II HAD LAID DOWN HIS TITLE AS EMPEROR OF THE HOLY
ROMAN EMPIREOF THE GERMAN NATION, WHICH HE DID AT THE COMMAND OF NAPOLEON,
THE CROWNAND MACE, AS THE IMPERIAL INSIGNIA, WERE KEPT IN VIENNA. AFTER
THE GERMAN EMPIRE WAS REFOUNDED, IN 1871, UNDER WILLIAM I, THERE WERE MANY
DEMANDS TOHAVE THE INSIGNIA TRANSFERRED TO BERLIN. BUT THESE WENT
UNHEEDED. HITLER HAD THEM BROUGHT TO GERMANY AFTER THE AUSTRIAN ANSCHLUSS
AND DISPLAYED AT NUREMBERG DURING THE PARTY CONGRESS IN SEPTEMBER 1938.]

WHEN THE HABSBURG STATE CRUMBLED TO PIECES IN 1918 THE AUSTRIAN GERMANS
INSTINCTIVELY RAISED AN OUTCRY FOR UNION WITH THEIR GERMAN FATHERLAND.
THAT WAS THE VOICE OF A UNANIMOUS YEARNING IN THE HEARTS OF THE WHOLE
PEOPLE FOR A RETURN TO THE UNFORGOTTEN HOME OF THEIR FATHERS. BUT SUCH A
GENERAL YEARNING COULD NOT BE EXPLAINED EXCEPT BY ATTRIBUTING THE CAUSE
OF IT TO THE HISTORICAL TRAINING THROUGH WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL AUSTRIAN
GERMANS HAD PASSED. THEREIN LAY A SPRING THAT NEVER DRIED UP. ESPECIALLY
IN TIMES OF DISTRACTION AND FORGETFULNESS ITS QUIET VOICE WAS A REMINDER
OF THE PAST, BIDDING THE PEOPLE TO LOOK OUT BEYOND THE MERE WELFARE OF
THE MOMENT TO A NEW FUTURE.

THE TEACHING OF UNIVERSAL HISTORY IN WHAT ARE CALLED THE MIDDLE SCHOOLS
IS STILL VERY UNSATISFACTORY. FEW TEACHERS REALIZE THAT THE PURPOSE OF
TEACHING HISTORY IS NOT THE MEMORIZING OF SOME DATES AND FACTS, THAT THE
STUDENT IS NOT INTERESTED IN KNOWING THE EXACT DATE OF A BATTLE OR THE
BIRTHDAY OF SOME MARSHAL OR OTHER, AND NOT AT ALL--OR AT LEAST ONLY VERY
INSIGNIFICANTLY--INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHEN THE CROWN OF HIS FATHERS WAS
PLACED ON THE BROW OF SOME MONARCH. THESE ARE CERTAINLY NOT LOOKED UPON
AS IMPORTANT MATTERS.

TO STUDY HISTORY MEANS TO SEARCH FOR AND DISCOVER THE FORCES THAT ARE
THE CAUSES OF THOSE RESULTS WHICH APPEAR BEFORE OUR EYES AS HISTORICAL
EVENTS. THE ART OF READING AND STUDYING CONSISTS IN REMEMBERING THE
ESSENTIALS AND FORGETTING WHAT IS NOT ESSENTIAL.

PROBABLY MY WHOLE FUTURE LIFE WAS DETERMINED BY THE FACT THAT I HAD A
PROFESSOR OF HISTORY WHO UNDERSTOOD, AS FEW OTHERS UNDERSTAND, HOW TO
MAKE THIS VIEWPOINT PREVAIL IN TEACHING AND IN EXAMINING. THIS TEACHER
WAS DR. LEOPOLD POETSCH, OF THE REALSCHULE AT LINZ. HE WAS THE IDEAL
PERSONIFICATION OF THE QUALITIES NECESSARY TO A TEACHER OF HISTORY IN
THE SENSE I HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE. AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WITH A DECISIVE
MANNER BUT A KINDLY HEART, HE WAS A VERY ATTRACTIVE SPEAKER AND WAS ABLE
TO INSPIRE US WITH HIS OWN ENTHUSIASM. EVEN TO-DAY I CANNOT RECALL
WITHOUT EMOTION THAT VENERABLE PERSONALITY WHOSE ENTHUSIASTIC EXPOSITION
OF HISTORY SO OFTEN MADE US ENTIRELY FORGET THE PRESENT AND ALLOW
OURSELVES TO BE TRANSPORTED AS IF BY MAGIC INTO THE PAST. HE PENETRATED
THROUGH THE DIM MIST OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND TRANSFORMED THE
HISTORICAL MEMORY OF THE DEAD PAST INTO A LIVING REALITY. WHEN WE
LISTENED TO HIM WE BECAME AFIRE WITH ENTHUSIASM AND WE WERE SOMETIMES
MOVED EVEN TO TEARS.

IT WAS STILL MORE FORTUNATE THAT THIS PROFESSOR WAS ABLE NOT ONLY TO
ILLUSTRATE THE PAST BY EXAMPLES FROM THE PRESENT BUT FROM THE PAST HE
WAS ALSO ABLE TO DRAW A LESSON FOR THE PRESENT. HE UNDERSTOOD BETTER
THAN ANY OTHER THE EVERYDAY PROBLEMS THAT WERE THEN AGITATING OUR MINDS.
THE NATIONAL FERVOUR WHICH WE FELT IN OUR OWN SMALL WAY WAS UTILIZED BY
HIM AS AN INSTRUMENT OF OUR EDUCATION, INASMUCH AS HE OFTEN APPEALED TO
OUR NATIONAL SENSE OF HONOUR; FOR IN THAT WAY HE MAINTAINED ORDER AND
HELD OUR ATTENTION MUCH MORE EASILY THAN HE COULD HAVE DONE BY ANY OTHER
MEANS. IT WAS BECAUSE I HAD SUCH A PROFESSOR THAT HISTORY BECAME MY
FAVOURITE SUBJECT. AS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE, BUT WITHOUT THE CONSCIOUS
CONNIVANCE OF MY PROFESSOR, I THEN AND THERE BECAME A YOUNG REBEL. BUT
WHO COULD HAVE STUDIED GERMAN HISTORY UNDER SUCH A TEACHER AND NOT
BECOME AN ENEMY OF THAT STATE WHOSE RULERS EXERCISED SUCH A DISASTROUS
INFLUENCE ON THE DESTINIES OF THE GERMAN NATION? FINALLY, HOW COULD ONE
REMAIN THE FAITHFUL SUBJECT OF THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG, WHOSE PAST HISTORY
AND PRESENT CONDUCT PROVED IT TO BE READY EVER AND ALWAYS TO BETRAY THE
INTERESTS OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE FOR THE SAKE OF PALTRY PERSONAL
INTERESTS? DID NOT WE AS YOUNGSTERS FULLY REALIZE THAT THE HOUSE OF
HABSBURG DID NOT, AND COULD NOT, HAVE ANY LOVE FOR US GERMANS?

WHAT HISTORY TAUGHT US ABOUT THE POLICY FOLLOWED BY THE HOUSE OF
HABSBURG WAS CORROBORATED BY OUR OWN EVERYDAY EXPERIENCES. IN THE NORTH
AND IN THE SOUTH THE POISON OF FOREIGN RACES WAS EATING INTO THE BODY OF
OUR PEOPLE, AND EVEN VIENNA WAS STEADILY BECOMING MORE AND MORE A
NON-GERMAN CITY. THE 'IMPERIAL HOUSE' FAVOURED THE CZECHS ON EVERY
POSSIBLE OCCASION. INDEED IT WAS THE HAND OF THE GODDESS OF ETERNAL
JUSTICE AND INEXORABLE RETRIBUTION THAT CAUSED THE MOST DEADLY ENEMY OF
GERMANISM IN AUSTRIA, THE ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND, TO FALL BY THE VERY
BULLETS WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD HELPED TO CAST. WORKING FROM ABOVE
DOWNWARDS, HE WAS THE CHIEF PATRON OF THE MOVEMENT TO MAKE AUSTRIA A
SLAV STATE.

THE BURDENS LAID ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE WERE ENORMOUS AND
THE SACRIFICES OF MONEY AND BLOOD WHICH THEY HAD TO MAKE WERE INCREDIBLY
HEAVY.

YET ANYBODY WHO WAS NOT QUITE BLIND MUST HAVE SEEN THAT IT WAS ALL IN
VAIN. WHAT AFFECTED US MOST BITTERLY WAS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE FACT
THAT THIS WHOLE SYSTEM WAS MORALLY SHIELDED BY THE ALLIANCE WITH
GERMANY, WHEREBY THE SLOW EXTIRPATION OF GERMANISM IN THE OLD AUSTRIAN
MONARCHY SEEMED IN SOME WAY TO BE MORE OR LESS SANCTIONED BY GERMANY
HERSELF. HABSBURG HYPOCRISY, WHICH ENDEAVOURED OUTWARDLY TO MAKE THE
PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT AUSTRIA STILL REMAINED A GERMAN STATE, INCREASED THE
FEELING OF HATRED AGAINST THE IMPERIAL HOUSE AND AT THE SAME TIME
AROUSED A SPIRIT OF REBELLION AND CONTEMPT.

BUT IN THE GERMAN EMPIRE ITSELF THOSE WHO WERE THEN ITS RULERS SAW
NOTHING OF WHAT ALL THIS MEANT. AS IF STRUCK BLIND, THEY STOOD BESIDE A
CORPSE AND IN THE VERY SYMPTOMS OF DECOMPOSITION THEY BELIEVED THAT THEY
RECOGNIZED THE SIGNS OF A RENEWED VITALITY. IN THAT UNHAPPY ALLIANCE
BETWEEN THE YOUNG GERMAN EMPIRE AND THE ILLUSORY AUSTRIAN STATE LAY THE
GERM OF THE WORLD WAR AND ALSO OF THE FINAL COLLAPSE.

IN THE SUBSEQUENT PAGES OF THIS BOOK I SHALL GO TO THE ROOT OF THE
PROBLEM. SUFFICE IT TO SAY HERE THAT IN THE VERY EARLY YEARS OF MY YOUTH
I CAME TO CERTAIN CONCLUSIONS WHICH I HAVE NEVER ABANDONED. INDEED I
BECAME MORE PROFOUNDLY CONVINCED OF THEM AS THE YEARS PASSED. THEY WERE:
THAT THE DISSOLUTION OF THE AUSTRIAN EMPIRE IS A PRELIMINARY CONDITION
FOR THE DEFENCE OF GERMANY; FURTHER, THAT NATIONAL FEELING IS BY NO
MEANS IDENTICAL WITH DYNASTIC PATRIOTISM; FINALLY, AND ABOVE ALL, THAT
THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG WAS DESTINED TO BRING MISFORTUNE TO THE GERMAN
NATION.

AS A LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OF THESE CONVICTIONS, THERE AROSE IN ME A
FEELING OF INTENSE LOVE FOR MY GERMAN-AUSTRIAN HOME AND A PROFOUND
HATRED FOR THE AUSTRIAN STATE.

THAT KIND OF HISTORICAL THINKING WHICH WAS DEVELOPED IN ME THROUGH MY
STUDY OF HISTORY AT SCHOOL NEVER LEFT ME AFTERWARDS. WORLD HISTORY
BECAME MORE AND MORE AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF
CONTEMPORARY HISTORICAL EVENTS, WHICH MEANS POLITICS. THEREFORE I WILL
NOT "LEARN" POLITICS BUT LET POLITICS TEACH ME.

A PRECOCIOUS REVOLUTIONARY IN POLITICS I WAS NO LESS A PRECOCIOUS
REVOLUTIONARY IN ART. AT THAT TIME THE PROVINCIAL CAPITAL OF UPPER
AUSTRIA HAD A THEATRE WHICH, RELATIVELY SPEAKING, WAS NOT BAD. ALMOST
EVERYTHING WAS PLAYED THERE. WHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD I SAW WILLIAM
TELL PERFORMED. THAT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF THE THEATRE. SOME MONTHS
LATER I ATTENDED A PERFORMANCE OF LOHENGRIN, THE FIRST OPERA I HAD EVER
HEARD. I WAS FASCINATED AT ONCE. MY YOUTHFUL ENTHUSIASM FOR THE BAYREUTH
MASTER KNEW NO LIMITS. AGAIN AND AGAIN I WAS DRAWN TO HEAR HIS OPERAS;
AND TO-DAY I CONSIDER IT A GREAT PIECE OF LUCK THAT THESE MODEST
PRODUCTIONS IN THE LITTLE PROVINCIAL CITY PREPARED THE WAY AND MADE IT
POSSIBLE FOR ME TO APPRECIATE THE BETTER PRODUCTIONS LATER ON.

BUT ALL THIS HELPED TO INTENSIFY MY PROFOUND AVERSION FOR THE CAREER
THAT MY FATHER HAD CHOSEN FOR ME; AND THIS DISLIKE BECAME ESPECIALLY
STRONG AS THE ROUGH CORNERS OF YOUTHFUL BOORISHNESS BECAME WORN OFF, A
PROCESS WHICH IN MY CASE CAUSED A GOOD DEAL OF PAIN. I BECAME MORE AND
MORE CONVINCED THAT I SHOULD NEVER BE HAPPY AS A STATE OFFICIAL. AND NOW
THAT THE REALSCHULE HAD RECOGNIZED AND ACKNOWLEDGED MY APTITUDE FOR
DRAWING, MY OWN RESOLUTION BECAME ALL THE STRONGER. IMPRECATIONS AND
THREATS HAD NO LONGER ANY CHANCE OF CHANGING IT. I WANTED TO BECOME A
PAINTER AND NO POWER IN THE WORLD COULD FORCE ME TO BECOME A CIVIL
SERVANT. THE ONLY PECULIAR FEATURE OF THE SITUATION NOW WAS THAT AS I
GREW BIGGER I BECAME MORE AND MORE INTERESTED IN ARCHITECTURE. I
CONSIDERED THIS FACT AS A NATURAL DEVELOPMENT OF MY FLAIR FOR PAINTING
AND I REJOICED INWARDLY THAT THE SPHERE OF MY ARTISTIC INTERESTS WAS
THUS ENLARGED. I HAD NO NOTION THAT ONE DAY IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
OTHERWISE.

THE QUESTION OF MY CAREER WAS DECIDED MUCH SOONER THAN I COULD HAVE
EXPECTED.

WHEN I WAS IN MY THIRTEENTH YEAR MY FATHER WAS SUDDENLY TAKEN FROM US.
HE WAS STILL IN ROBUST HEALTH WHEN A STROKE OF APOPLEXY PAINLESSLY ENDED
HIS EARTHLY WANDERINGS AND LEFT US ALL DEEPLY BEREAVED. HIS MOST ARDENT
LONGING WAS TO BE ABLE TO HELP HIS SON TO ADVANCE IN A CAREER AND THUS
SAVE ME FROM THE HARSH ORDEAL THAT HE HIMSELF HAD TO GO THROUGH. BUT IT
APPEARED TO HIM THEN AS IF THAT LONGING WERE ALL IN VAIN. AND YET,
THOUGH HE HIMSELF WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF IT, HE HAD SOWN THE SEEDS OF A
FUTURE WHICH NEITHER OF US FORESAW AT THAT TIME.

AT FIRST NOTHING CHANGED OUTWARDLY.

MY MOTHER FELT IT HER DUTY TO CONTINUE MY EDUCATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH
MY FATHER'S WISHES, WHICH MEANT THAT SHE WOULD HAVE ME STUDY FOR THE
CIVIL SERVICE. FOR MY OWN PART I WAS EVEN MORE FIRMLY DETERMINED THAN
EVER BEFORE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD I BECOME AN OFFICIAL OF
THE STATE. THE CURRICULUM AND TEACHING METHODS FOLLOWED IN THE MIDDLE
SCHOOL WERE SO FAR REMOVED FROM MY IDEALS THAT I BECAME PROFOUNDLY
INDIFFERENT. ILLNESS SUDDENLY CAME TO MY ASSISTANCE. WITHIN A FEW WEEKS
IT DECIDED MY FUTURE AND PUT AN END TO THE LONG-STANDING FAMILY
CONFLICT. MY LUNGS BECAME SO SERIOUSLY AFFECTED THAT THE DOCTOR ADVISED
MY MOTHER VERY STRONGLY NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TO ALLOW ME TO TAKE
UP A CAREER WHICH WOULD NECESSITATE WORKING IN AN OFFICE. HE ORDERED
THAT I SHOULD GIVE UP ATTENDANCE AT THE REALSCHULE FOR A YEAR AT LEAST.
WHAT I HAD SECRETLY DESIRED FOR SUCH A LONG TIME, AND HAD PERSISTENTLY
FOUGHT FOR, NOW BECAME A REALITY ALMOST AT ONE STROKE.

INFLUENCED BY MY ILLNESS, MY MOTHER AGREED THAT I SHOULD LEAVE THE
REALSCHULE AND ATTEND THE ACADEMY.

THOSE WERE HAPPY DAYS, WHICH APPEARED TO ME ALMOST AS A DREAM; BUT THEY
WERE BOUND TO REMAIN ONLY A DREAM. TWO YEARS LATER MY MOTHER'S DEATH PUT
A BRUTAL END TO ALL MY FINE PROJECTS. SHE SUCCUMBED TO A LONG AND
PAINFUL ILLNESS WHICH FROM THE VERY BEGINNING PERMITTED LITTLE HOPE OF
RECOVERY. THOUGH EXPECTED, HER DEATH CAME AS A TERRIBLE BLOW TO ME. I
RESPECTED MY FATHER, BUT I LOVED MY MOTHER.

POVERTY AND STERN REALITY FORCED ME TO DECIDE PROMPTLY.

THE MEAGRE RESOURCES OF THE FAMILY HAD BEEN ALMOST ENTIRELY USED UP
THROUGH MY MOTHER'S SEVERE ILLNESS. THE ALLOWANCE WHICH CAME TO ME AS AN
ORPHAN WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE BARE NECESSITIES OF LIFE. SOMEHOW OR OTHER
I WOULD HAVE TO EARN MY OWN BREAD.

WITH MY CLOTHES AND LINEN PACKED IN A VALISE AND WITH AN INDOMITABLE
RESOLUTION IN MY HEART, I LEFT FOR VIENNA. I HOPED TO FORESTALL FATE, AS
MY FATHER HAD DONE FIFTY YEARS BEFORE. I WAS DETERMINED TO BECOME
'SOMETHING'--BUT CERTAINLY NOT A CIVIL SERVANT.




CHAPTER II



YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA


WHEN MY MOTHER DIED MY FATE HAD ALREADY BEEN DECIDED IN ONE RESPECT.
DURING THE LAST MONTHS OF HER ILLNESS I WENT TO VIENNA TO TAKE THE
ENTRANCE EXAMINATION FOR THE ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS. ARMED WITH A BULKY
PACKET OF SKETCHES, I FELT CONVINCED THAT I SHOULD PASS THE EXAMINATION
QUITE EASILY. AT THE REALSCHULE I WAS BY FAR THE BEST STUDENT IN THE
DRAWING CLASS, AND SINCE THAT TIME I HAD MADE MORE THAN ORDINARY
PROGRESS IN THE PRACTICE OF DRAWING. THEREFORE I WAS PLEASED WITH MYSELF
AND WAS PROUD AND HAPPY AT THE PROSPECT OF WHAT I CONSIDERED AN ASSURED
SUCCESS.

BUT THERE WAS ONE MISGIVING: IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I WAS BETTER QUALIFIED
FOR DRAWING THAN FOR PAINTING, ESPECIALLY IN THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF
ARCHITECTURAL DRAWING. AT THE SAME TIME MY INTEREST IN ARCHITECTURE WAS
CONSTANTLY INCREASING. AND I ADVANCED IN THIS DIRECTION AT A STILL MORE
RAPID PACE AFTER MY FIRST VISIT TO VIENNA, WHICH LASTED TWO WEEKS. I WAS
NOT YET SIXTEEN YEARS OLD. I WENT TO THE HOF MUSEUM TO STUDY THE
PAINTINGS IN THE ART GALLERY THERE; BUT THE BUILDING ITSELF CAPTURED
ALMOST ALL MY INTEREST, FROM EARLY MORNING UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT I SPENT
ALL MY TIME VISITING THE VARIOUS PUBLIC BUILDINGS. AND IT WAS THE
BUILDINGS THEMSELVES THAT WERE ALWAYS THE PRINCIPAL ATTRACTION FOR ME.
FOR HOURS AND HOURS I COULD STAND IN WONDERMENT BEFORE THE OPERA AND THE
PARLIAMENT. THE WHOLE RING STRASSE HAD A MAGIC EFFECT UPON ME, AS IF IT
WERE A SCENE FROM THE THOUSAND-AND-ONE-NIGHTS.

AND NOW I WAS HERE FOR THE SECOND TIME IN THIS BEAUTIFUL CITY,
IMPATIENTLY WAITING TO HEAR THE RESULT OF THE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION BUT
PROUDLY CONFIDENT THAT I HAD GOT THROUGH. I WAS SO CONVINCED OF MY
SUCCESS THAT WHEN THE NEWS THAT I HAD FAILED TO PASS WAS BROUGHT TO ME
IT STRUCK ME LIKE A BOLT FROM THE SKIES. YET THE FACT WAS THAT I HAD
FAILED. I WENT TO SEE THE RECTOR AND ASKED HIM TO EXPLAIN THE REASONS
WHY THEY REFUSED TO ACCEPT ME AS A STUDENT IN THE GENERAL SCHOOL OF
PAINTING, WHICH WAS PART OF THE ACADEMY. HE SAID THAT THE SKETCHES WHICH
I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME UNQUESTIONABLY SHOWED THAT PAINTING WAS NOT WHAT I
WAS SUITED FOR BUT THAT THE SAME SKETCHES GAVE CLEAR INDICATIONS OF MY
APTITUDE FOR ARCHITECTURAL DESIGNING. THEREFORE THE SCHOOL OF PAINTING
DID NOT COME INTO QUESTION FOR ME BUT RATHER THE SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE,
WHICH ALSO FORMED PART OF THE ACADEMY. AT FIRST IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD BE SO, SEEING THAT I HAD NEVER BEEN TO A
SCHOOL FOR ARCHITECTURE AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED ANY INSTRUCTION IN
ARCHITECTURAL DESIGNING.

WHEN I LEFT THE HANSEN PALACE, ON THE SCHILLER PLATZ, I WAS QUITE
CRESTFALLEN. I FELT OUT OF SORTS WITH MYSELF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY
YOUNG LIFE. FOR WHAT I HAD HEARD ABOUT MY CAPABILITIES NOW APPEARED TO
ME AS A LIGHTNING FLASH WHICH CLEARLY REVEALED A DUALISM UNDER WHICH I
HAD BEEN SUFFERING FOR A LONG TIME, BUT HITHERTO I COULD GIVE NO CLEAR
ACCOUNT WHATSOEVER OF THE WHY AND WHEREFORE.

WITHIN A FEW DAYS I MYSELF ALSO KNEW THAT I OUGHT TO BECOME AN
ARCHITECT. BUT OF COURSE THE WAY WAS VERY DIFFICULT. I WAS NOW FORCED
BITTERLY TO RUE MY FORMER CONDUCT IN NEGLECTING AND DESPISING CERTAIN
SUBJECTS AT THE REALSCHULE. BEFORE TAKING UP THE COURSES AT THE SCHOOL
OF ARCHITECTURE IN THE ACADEMY IT WAS NECESSARY TO ATTEND THE TECHNICAL
BUILDING SCHOOL; BUT A NECESSARY QUALIFICATION FOR ENTRANCE INTO THIS
SCHOOL WAS A LEAVING CERTIFICATE FROM THE MIDDLE SCHOOL. AND THIS I
SIMPLY DID NOT HAVE. ACCORDING TO THE HUMAN MEASURE OF THINGS MY DREAM
OF FOLLOWING AN ARTISTIC CALLING SEEMED BEYOND THE LIMITS OF
POSSIBILITY.

AFTER THE DEATH OF MY MOTHER I CAME TO VIENNA FOR THE THIRD TIME. THIS
VISIT WAS DESTINED TO LAST SEVERAL YEARS. SINCE I HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE
I HAD RECOVERED MY OLD CALM AND RESOLUTENESS. THE FORMER SELF-ASSURANCE
HAD COME BACK, AND I HAD MY EYES STEADILY FIXED ON THE GOAL. I WOULD BE
AN ARCHITECT. OBSTACLES ARE PLACED ACROSS OUR PATH IN LIFE, NOT TO BE
BOGGLED AT BUT TO BE SURMOUNTED. AND I WAS FULLY DETERMINED TO SURMOUNT
THESE OBSTACLES, HAVING THE PICTURE OF MY FATHER CONSTANTLY BEFORE MY
MIND, WHO HAD RAISED HIMSELF BY HIS OWN EFFORTS TO THE POSITION OF A
CIVIL SERVANT THOUGH HE WAS THE POOR SON OF A VILLAGE SHOEMAKER. I HAD A
BETTER START, AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF STRUGGLING THROUGH WERE BETTER.
AT THAT TIME MY LOT IN LIFE SEEMED TO ME A HARSH ONE; BUT TO-DAY I SEE
IN IT THE WISE WORKINGS OF PROVIDENCE. THE GODDESS OF FATE CLUTCHED ME
IN HER HANDS AND OFTEN THREATENED TO SMASH ME; BUT THE WILL GREW
STRONGER AS THE OBSTACLES INCREASED, AND FINALLY THE WILL TRIUMPHED.

I AM THANKFUL FOR THAT PERIOD OF MY LIFE, BECAUSE IT HARDENED ME AND
ENABLED ME TO BE AS TOUGH AS I NOW AM. AND I AM EVEN MORE THANKFUL
BECAUSE I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT I WAS THUS SAVED FROM THE EMPTINESS
OF A LIFE OF EASE AND THAT A MOTHER'S DARLING WAS TAKEN FROM TENDER ARMS
AND HANDED OVER TO ADVERSITY AS TO A NEW MOTHER. THOUGH I THEN REBELLED
AGAINST IT AS TOO HARD A FATE, I AM GRATEFUL THAT I WAS THROWN INTO A
WORLD OF MISERY AND POVERTY AND THUS CAME TO KNOW THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM I
WAS AFTERWARDS TO FIGHT.

IT WAS DURING THIS PERIOD THAT MY EYES WERE OPENED TO TWO PERILS, THE
NAMES OF WHICH I SCARCELY KNEW HITHERTO AND HAD NO NOTION WHATSOEVER OF
THEIR TERRIBLE SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE.
THESE TWO PERILS WERE MARXISM AND JUDAISM.

FOR MANY PEOPLE THE NAME OF VIENNA SIGNIFIES INNOCENT JOLLITY, A FESTIVE
PLACE FOR HAPPY MORTALS. FOR ME, ALAS, IT IS A LIVING MEMORY OF THE
SADDEST PERIOD IN MY LIFE. EVEN TO-DAY THE MENTION OF THAT CITY AROUSES
ONLY GLOOMY THOUGHTS IN MY MIND. FIVE YEARS OF POVERTY IN THAT PHAECIAN
(NOTE 5) TOWN. FIVE YEARS IN WHICH, FIRST AS A CASUAL LABOURER AND THEN AS
A PAINTER OF LITTLE TRIFLES, I HAD TO EARN MY DAILY BREAD. AND A MEAGRE
MORSEL INDEED IT WAS, NOT EVEN SUFFICIENT TO STILL THE HUNGER WHICH I
CONSTANTLY FELT. THAT HUNGER WAS THE FAITHFUL GUARDIAN WHICH NEVER LEFT
ME BUT TOOK PART IN EVERYTHING I DID. EVERY BOOK THAT I BOUGHT MEANT
RENEWED HUNGER, AND EVERY VISIT I PAID TO THE OPERA MEANT THE INTRUSION
OF THAT INALIENABL COMPANION DURING THE FOLLOWING DAYS. I WAS ALWAYS
STRUGGLING WITH MY UNSYMPATHIC FRIEND. AND YET DURING THAT TIME I
LEARNED MORE THAN I HAD EVER LEARNED BEFORE. OUTSIDE MY ARCHITECTURAL
STUDIES AND RARE VISITS TO THE OPERA, FOR WHICH I HAD TO DENY MYSELF
FOOD, I HAD NO OTHER PLEASURE IN LIFE EXCEPT MY BOOKS.

[NOTE 5. THE PHAECIANS WERE A LEGENDARY PEOPLE, MENTIONED IN HOMER'S
ODYSSEY. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO LIVE ON SOME UNKNOWN ISLAND IN THE EASTERN
MEDITERRANEAN, SOMETIMES SUGGESTED TO BE CORCYRA, THE MODERN CORFU. THEY
LOVED GOOD LIVING MORE THAN WORK, AND SO THE NAME PHAECIAN HAS COME TO BE
A SYNONYM FOR PARASITE.]

I READ A GREAT DEAL THEN, AND I PONDERED DEEPLY OVER WHAT I READ. ALL
THE FREE TIME AFTER WORK WAS DEVOTED EXCLUSIVELY TO STUDY. THUS WITHIN A
FEW YEARS I WAS ABLE TO ACQUIRE A STOCK OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH I FIND USEFUL
EVEN TO-DAY.

BUT MORE THAN THAT. DURING THOSE YEARS A VIEW OF LIFE AND A DEFINITE
OUTLOOK ON THE WORLD TOOK SHAPE IN MY MIND. THESE BECAME THE GRANITE
BASIS OF MY CONDUCT AT THAT TIME. SINCE THEN I HAVE EXTENDED THAT
FOUNDATION ONLY VERY LITTLE, AND I HAVE CHANGED NOTHING IN IT.

ON THE CONTRARY: I AM FIRMLY CONVINCED TO-DAY THAT, GENERALLY SPEAKING,
IT IS IN YOUTH THAT MEN LAY THE ESSENTIAL GROUNDWORK OF THEIR CREATIVE
THOUGHT, WHEREVER THAT CREATIVE THOUGHT EXISTS. I MAKE A DISTINCTION
BETWEEN THE WISDOM OF AGE--WHICH CAN ONLY ARISE FROM THE GREATER
PROFUNDITY AND FORESIGHT THAT ARE BASED ON THE EXPERIENCES OF A LONG
LIFE--AND THE CREATIVE GENIUS OF YOUTH, WHICH BLOSSOMS OUT IN THOUGHT
AND IDEAS WITH INEXHAUSTIBLE FERTILITY, WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO PUT THESE
INTO PRACTICE IMMEDIATELY, BECAUSE OF THEIR VERY SUPERABUNDANCE. THESE
FURNISH THE BUILDING MATERIALS AND PLANS FOR THE FUTURE; AND IT IS FROM
THEM THAT AGE TAKES THE STONES AND BUILDS THE EDIFICE, UNLESS THE
SO-CALLED WISDOM OF THE YEARS MAY HAVE SMOTHERED THE CREATIVE GENIUS OF
YOUTH.

THE LIFE WHICH I HAD HITHERTO LED AT HOME WITH MY PARENTS DIFFERED IN
LITTLE OR NOTHING FROM THAT OF ALL THE OTHERS. I LOOKED FORWARD WITHOUT
APPREHENSION TO THE MORROW, AND THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS A SOCIAL
PROBLEM TO BE FACED. THOSE AMONG WHOM I PASSED MY YOUNG DAYS BELONGED TO
THE SMALL BOURGEOIS CLASS. THEREFORE IT WAS A WORLD THAT HAD VERY LITTLE
CONTACT WITH THE WORLD OF GENUINE MANUAL LABOURERS. FOR, THOUGH AT FIRST
THIS MAY APPEAR ASTONISHING, THE DITCH WHICH SEPARATES THAT CLASS, WHICH
IS BY NO MEANS ECONOMICALLY WELL-OFF; FROM THE MANUAL LABOURING CLASS IS
OFTEN DEEPER THAN PEOPLE THINK. THE REASON FOR THIS DIVISION, WHICH WE
MAY ALMOST CALL ENMITY, LIES IN THE FEAR THAT DOMINATES A SOCIAL GROUP
WHICH HAS ONLY JUST RISEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE MANUAL LABOURER--A FEAR
LEST IT MAY FALL BACK INTO ITS OLD CONDITION OR AT LEAST BE CLASSED WITH
THE LABOURERS. MOREOVER, THERE IS SOMETHING REPULSIVE IN REMEMBERING THE
CULTURAL INDIGENCE OF THAT LOWER CLASS AND THEIR ROUGH MANNERS WITH ONE
ANOTHER; SO THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ONLY ON THE FIRST RUNG OF THE SOCIAL
LADDER FIND IT UNBEARABLE TO BE FORCED TO HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH THE
CULTURAL LEVEL AND STANDARD OF LIVING OUT OF WHICH THEY HAVE PASSED.

AND SO IT HAPPENS THAT VERY OFTEN THOSE WHO BELONG TO WHAT CAN REALLY BE
CALLED THE UPPER CLASSES FIND IT MUCH EASIER THAN DO THE UPSTARTS TO
DESCEND TO AND INTERMINGLE WITH THEIR FELLOW BEINGS ON THE LOWEST SOCIAL
LEVEL. FOR BY THE WORD UPSTART I MEAN EVERYONE WHO HAS RAISED HIMSELF
THROUGH HIS OWN EFFORTS TO A SOCIAL LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAT TO WHICH HE
FORMERLY BELONGED. IN THE CASE OF SUCH A PERSON THE HARD STRUGGLE
THROUGH WHICH HE PASSES OFTEN DESTROYS HIS NORMAL HUMAN SYMPATHY. HIS
OWN FIGHT FOR EXISTENCE KILLS HIS SENSIBILITY FOR THE MISERY OF THOSE
WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND.

FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW FATE HAD BEEN KIND TO ME. CIRCUMSTANCES FORCED
ME TO RETURN TO THAT WORLD OF POVERTY AND ECONOMIC INSECURITY ABOVE
WHICH MY FATHER HAD RAISED HIMSELF IN HIS EARLY DAYS; AND THUS THE
BLINKERS OF A NARROW PETIT BOURGEOIS EDUCATION WERE TORN FROM MY EYES.
NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME I LEARNED TO KNOW MEN AND I LEARNED TO
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN EMPTY APPEARANCES OR BRUTAL MANNERS AND THE REAL
INNER NATURE OF THE PEOPLE WHO OUTWARDLY APPEARED THUS.

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY VIENNA HAD ALREADY TAKEN RANK AMONG
THOSE CITIES WHERE SOCIAL CONDITIONS ARE INIQUITOUS. DAZZLING RICHES AND
LOATHSOME DESTITUTION WERE INTERMINGLED IN VIOLENT CONTRAST. IN THE
CENTRE AND IN THE INNER CITY ONE FELT THE PULSE-BEAT OF AN EMPIRE WHICH
HAD A POPULATION OF FIFTY-TWO MILLIONS, WITH ALL THE PERILOUS CHARM OF A
STATE MADE UP OF MULTIPLE NATIONALITIES. THE DAZZLING SPLENDOUR OF THE
COURT ACTED LIKE A MAGNET ON THE WEALTH AND INTELLIGENCE OF THE WHOLE
EMPIRE. AND THIS ATTRACTION WAS FURTHER STRENGTHENED BY THE DYNASTIC
POLICY OF THE HABSBURG MONARCHY IN CENTRALIZING EVERYTHING IN ITSELF AND
FOR ITSELF.

THIS CENTRALIZING POLICY WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO HOLD TOGETHER THAT
HOTCHPOTCH OF HETEROGENEOUS NATIONALITIES. BUT THE RESULT OF IT WAS AN
EXTRAORDINARY CONCENTRATION OF HIGHER OFFICIALS IN THE CITY, WHICH WAS
AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME THE METROPOLIS AND IMPERIAL RESIDENCE.

BUT VIENNA WAS NOT MERELY THE POLITICAL AND INTELLECTUAL CENTRE OF THE
DANUBIAN MONARCHY; IT WAS ALSO THE COMMERCIAL CENTRE. BESIDES THE HORDE
OF MILITARY OFFICERS OF HIGH RANK, STATE OFFICIALS, ARTISTS AND
SCIENTISTS, THERE WAS THE STILL VASTER HORDE OF WORKERS. ABJECT POVERTY
CONFRONTED THE WEALTH OF THE ARISTOCRACY AND THE MERCHANT CLASS FACE TO
FACE. THOUSANDS OF UNEMPLOYED LOITERED IN FRONT OF THE PALACES ON THE
RING STRASSE; AND BELOW THAT VIA TRIUMPHALIS OF THE OLD AUSTRIA THE
HOMELESS HUDDLED TOGETHER IN THE MURK AND FILTH OF THE CANALS.

THERE WAS HARDLY ANY OTHER GERMAN CITY IN WHICH THE SOCIAL PROBLEM COULD
BE STUDIED BETTER THAN IN VIENNA. BUT HERE I MUST UTTER A WARNING
AGAINST THE ILLUSION THAT THIS PROBLEM CAN BE 'STUDIED' FROM ABOVE
DOWNWARDS. THE MAN WHO HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE CLUTCHES OF THAT CRUSHING
VIPER CAN NEVER KNOW WHAT ITS POISON IS. AN ATTEMPT TO STUDY IT IN ANY
OTHER WAY WILL RESULT ONLY IN SUPERFICIAL TALK AND SENTIMENTAL
DELUSIONS. BOTH ARE HARMFUL. THE FIRST BECAUSE IT CAN NEVER GO TO THE
ROOT OF THE QUESTION, THE SECOND BECAUSE IT EVADES THE QUESTION
ENTIRELY. I DO NOT KNOW WHICH IS THE MORE NEFARIOUS: TO IGNORE SOCIAL
DISTRESS, AS DO THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN FAVOURED BY FORTUNE
AND THOSE WHO HAVE RISEN IN THE SOCIAL SCALE THROUGH THEIR OWN ROUTINE
LABOUR, OR THE EQUALLY SUPERCILIOUS AND OFTEN TACTLESS BUT ALWAYS
GENTEEL CONDESCENSION DISPLAYED BY PEOPLE WHO MAKE A FAD OF BEING
CHARITABLE AND WHO PLUME THEMSELVES ON 'SYMPATHISING WITH THE PEOPLE.'
OF COURSE SUCH PERSONS SIN MORE THAN THEY CAN IMAGINE FROM LACK OF
INSTINCTIVE UNDERSTANDING. AND THUS THEY ARE ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT THE
'SOCIAL CONSCIENCE' ON WHICH THEY PRIDE THEMSELVES NEVER PRODUCES ANY
RESULTS, BUT OFTEN CAUSES THEIR GOOD INTENTIONS TO BE RESENTED; AND THEN
THEY TALK OF THE INGRATITUDE OF THE PEOPLE.

SUCH PERSONS ARE SLOW TO LEARN THAT HERE THERE IS NO PLACE FOR MERELY
SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND THAT THERE CAN BE NO EXPECTATION OF GRATITUDE; FOR
IN THIS CONNECTION THERE IS NO QUESTION AT ALL OF DISTRIBUTING FAVOURS
BUT ESSENTIALLY A MATTER OF RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE. I WAS PROTECTED AGAINST
THE TEMPTATION TO STUDY THE SOCIAL QUESTION IN THE WAY JUST MENTIONED,
FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT I WAS FORCED TO LIVE IN THE MIDST OF
POVERTY-STRICKEN PEOPLE. THEREFORE IT WAS NOT A QUESTION OF STUDYING THE
PROBLEM OBJECTIVELY, BUT RATHER ONE OF TESTING ITS EFFECTS ON MYSELF.
THOUGH THE RABBIT CAME THROUGH THE ORDEAL OF THE EXPERIMENT, THIS MUST
NOT BE TAKEN AS EVIDENCE OF ITS HARMLESSNESS.

WHEN I TRY TO-DAY TO RECALL THE SUCCESSION OF IMPRESSIONS RECEIVED
DURING THAT TIME I FIND THAT I CAN DO SO ONLY WITH APPROXIMATE
COMPLETENESS. HERE I SHALL DESCRIBE ONLY THE MORE ESSENTIAL IMPRESSIONS
AND THOSE WHICH PERSONALLY AFFECTED ME AND OFTEN STAGGERED ME. AND I
SHALL MENTION THE FEW LESSONS I THEN LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE.

AT THAT TIME IT WAS FOR THE MOST PART NOT VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND WORK,
BECAUSE I HAD TO SEEK WORK NOT AS A SKILLED TRADESMAN BUT AS A SO-CALLED
EXTRA-HAND READY TO TAKE ANY JOB THAT TURNED UP BY CHANCE, JUST FOR THE
SAKE OF EARNING MY DAILY BREAD.

THUS I FOUND MYSELF IN THE SAME SITUATION AS ALL THOSE EMIGRANTS WHO
SHAKE THE DUST OF EUROPE FROM THEIR FEET, WITH THE CAST-IRON
DETERMINATION TO LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF A NEW EXISTENCE IN THE NEW WORLD
AND ACQUIRE FOR THEMSELVES A NEW HOME. LIBERATED FROM ALL THE PARALYSING
PREJUDICES OF CLASS AND CALLING, ENVIRONMENT AND TRADITION, THEY ENTER
ANY SERVICE THAT OPENS ITS DOORS TO THEM, ACCEPTING ANY WORK THAT COMES
THEIR WAY, FILLED MORE AND MORE WITH THE IDEA THAT HONEST WORK NEVER
DISGRACED ANYBODY, NO MATTER WHAT KIND IT MAY BE. AND SO I WAS RESOLVED
TO SET BOTH FEET IN WHAT WAS FOR ME A NEW WORLD AND PUSH FORWARD ON MY
OWN ROAD.

I SOON FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS SOME KIND OF WORK ALWAYS TO BE GOT, BUT
I ALSO LEARNED THAT IT COULD JUST AS QUICKLY AND EASILY BE LOST. THE
UNCERTAINTY OF BEING ABLE TO EARN A REGULAR DAILY LIVELIHOOD SOON
APPEARED TO ME AS THE GLOOMIEST FEATURE IN THIS NEW LIFE THAT I HAD
ENTERED.

ALTHOUGH THE SKILLED WORKER WAS NOT SO FREQUENTLY THROWN IDLE ON THE
STREETS AS THE UNSKILLED WORKER, YET THE FORMER WAS BY NO MEANS
PROTECTED AGAINST THE SAME FATE; BECAUSE THOUGH HE MAY NOT HAVE TO FACE
HUNGER AS A RESULT OF UNEMPLOYMENT DUE TO THE LACK OF DEMAND IN THE
LABOUR MARKET, THE LOCK-OUT AND THE STRIKE DEPRIVED THE SKILLED WORKER
OF THE CHANCE TO EARN HIS BREAD. HERE THE ELEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY IN
STEADILY EARNING ONE'S DAILY BREAD WAS THE BITTEREST FEATURE OF THE
WHOLE SOCIAL-ECONOMIC SYSTEM ITSELF.

THE COUNTRY LAD WHO MIGRATES TO THE BIG CITY FEELS ATTRACTED BY WHAT HAS
BEEN DESCRIBED AS EASY WORK--WHICH IT MAY BE IN REALITY--AND FEW WORKING
HOURS. HE IS ESPECIALLY ENTRANCED BY THE MAGIC GLIMMER SPREAD OVER THE
BIG CITIES. ACCUSTOMED IN THE COUNTRY TO EARN A STEADY WAGE, HE HAS BEEN
TAUGHT NOT TO QUIT HIS FORMER POST UNTIL A NEW ONE IS AT LEAST IN SIGHT.
AS THERE IS A GREAT SCARCITY OF AGRICULTURAL LABOUR, THE PROBABILITY OF
LONG UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN VERY SMALL. IT IS A MISTAKE TO
PRESUME THAT THE LAD WHO LEAVES THE COUNTRYSIDE FOR THE TOWN IS NOT MADE
OF SUCH SOUND MATERIAL AS THOSE WHO REMAIN AT HOME TO WORK ON THE LAND.
ON THE CONTRARY, EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT IT IS THE MORE HEALTHY AND MORE
VIGOROUS THAT EMIGRATE, AND NOT THE REVERSE. AMONG THESE EMIGRANTS I
INCLUDE NOT MERELY THOSE WHO EMIGRATE TO AMERICA, BUT ALSO THE SERVANT
BOY IN THE COUNTRY WHO DECIDES TO LEAVE HIS NATIVE VILLAGE AND MIGRATE
TO THE BIG CITY WHERE HE WILL BE A STRANGER. HE IS READY TO TAKE THE
RISK OF AN UNCERTAIN FATE. IN MOST CASES HE COMES TO TOWN WITH A LITTLE
MONEY IN HIS POCKET AND FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS HE IS NOT DISCOURAGED IF
HE SHOULD NOT HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND WORK. BUT IF HE FINDS A JOB
AND THEN LOSES IT IN A LITTLE WHILE, THE CASE IS MUCH WORSE. TO FIND
WORK ANEW, ESPECIALLY IN WINTER, IS OFTEN DIFFICULT AND INDEED SOMETIMES
IMPOSSIBLE. FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS LIFE IS STILL BEARABLE HE RECEIVES
HIS OUT-OF-WORK MONEY FROM HIS TRADE UNION AND IS THUS ENABLED TO CARRY
ON. BUT WHEN THE LAST OF HIS OWN MONEY IS GONE AND HIS TRADE UNION
CEASES TO PAY OUT BECAUSE OF THE PROLONGED UNEMPLOYMENT, THEN COMES THE
REAL DISTRESS. HE NOW LOITERS ABOUT AND IS HUNGRY. OFTEN HE PAWNS OR
SELLS THE LAST OF HIS BELONGINGS. HIS CLOTHES BEGIN TO GET SHABBY AND
WITH THE INCREASING POVERTY OF HIS OUTWARD APPEARANCE HE DESCENDS TO A
LOWER SOCIAL LEVEL AND MIXES UP WITH A CLASS OF HUMAN BEINGS THROUGH
WHOM HIS MIND IS NOW POISONED, IN ADDITION TO HIS PHYSICAL MISERY. THEN
HE HAS NOWHERE TO SLEEP AND IF THAT HAPPENS IN WINTER, WHICH IS VERY
OFTEN THE CASE, HE IS IN DIRE DISTRESS. FINALLY HE GETS WORK. BUT THE
OLD STORY REPEATS ITSELF. A SECOND TIME THE SAME THING HAPPENS. THEN A
THIRD TIME; AND NOW IT IS PROBABLY MUCH WORSE. LITTLE BY LITTLE HE
BECOMES INDIFFERENT TO THIS EVERLASTING INSECURITY. FINALLY HE GROWS
USED TO THE REPETITION. THUS EVEN A MAN WHO IS NORMALLY OF INDUSTRIOUS
HABITS GROWS CARELESS IN HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE TOWARDS LIFE AND GRADUALLY
BECOMES AN INSTRUMENT IN THE HANDS OF UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE WHO EXPLOIT
HIM FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR OWN IGNOBLE AIMS. HE HAS BEEN SO OFTEN THROWN
OUT OF EMPLOYMENT THROUGH NO FAULT OF HIS OWN THAT HE IS NOW MORE OR
LESS INDIFFERENT WHETHER THE STRIKE IN WHICH HE TAKES PART BE FOR THE
PURPOSE OF SECURING HIS ECONOMIC RIGHTS OR BE AIMED AT THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE STATE, THE WHOLE SOCIAL ORDER AND EVEN CIVILIZATION ITSELF.
THOUGH THE IDEA OF GOING ON STRIKE MAY NOT BE TO HIS NATURAL LIKING, YET
HE JOINS IN IT OUT OF SHEER INDIFFERENCE.

I SAW THIS PROCESS EXEMPLIFIED BEFORE MY EYES IN THOUSANDS OF CASES. AND
THE LONGER I OBSERVED IT THE GREATER BECAME MY DISLIKE FOR THAT MAMMOTH
CITY WHICH GREEDILY ATTRACTS MEN TO ITS BOSOM, IN ORDER TO BREAK THEM
MERCILESSLY IN THE END. WHEN THEY CAME THEY STILL FELT THEMSELVES IN
COMMUNION WITH THEIR OWN PEOPLE AT HOME; IF THEY REMAINED THAT TIE WAS
BROKEN.

I WAS THROWN ABOUT SO MUCH IN THE LIFE OF THE METROPOLIS THAT I
EXPERIENCED THE WORKINGS OF THIS FATE IN MY OWN PERSON AND FELT THE
EFFECTS OF IT IN MY OWN SOUL. ONE THING STOOD OUT CLEARLY BEFORE MY
EYES: IT WAS THE SUDDEN CHANGES FROM WORK TO IDLENESS AND VICE VERSA; SO
THAT THE CONSTANT FLUCTUATIONS THUS CAUSED BY EARNINGS AND EXPENDITURE
FINALLY DESTROYED THE 'SENSE OF THRIFT FOR MANY PEOPLE AND ALSO THE
HABIT OF REGULATING EXPENDITURE IN AN INTELLIGENT WAY. THE BODY APPEARED
TO GROW ACCUSTOMED TO THE VICISSITUDES OF FOOD AND HUNGER, EATING
HEARTILY IN GOOD TIMES AND GOING HUNGRY IN BAD. INDEED HUNGER SHATTERS
ALL PLANS FOR RATIONING EXPENDITURE ON A REGULAR SCALE IN BETTER TIMES
WHEN EMPLOYMENT IS AGAIN FOUND. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE
DEPRIVATIONS WHICH THE UNEMPLOYED WORKER HAS TO ENDURE MUST BE
COMPENSATED FOR PSYCHOLOGICALLY BY A PERSISTENT MENTAL MIRAGE IN WHICH
HE IMAGINES HIMSELF EATING HEARTILY ONCE AGAIN. AND THIS DREAM DEVELOPS
INTO SUCH A LONGING THAT IT TURNS INTO A MORBID IMPULSE TO CAST OFF ALL
SELF-RESTRAINT WHEN WORK AND WAGES TURN UP AGAIN. THEREFORE THE MOMENT
WORK IS FOUND ANEW HE FORGETS TO REGULATE THE EXPENDITURE OF HIS
EARNINGS BUT SPENDS THEM TO THE FULL WITHOUT THINKING OF TO-MORROW. THIS
LEADS TO CONFUSION IN THE LITTLE WEEKLY HOUSEKEEPING BUDGET, BECAUSE THE
EXPENDITURE IS NOT RATIONALLY PLANNED. WHEN THE PHENOMENON WHICH I HAVE
MENTIONED FIRST HAPPENS, THE EARNINGS WILL LAST PERHAPS FOR FIVE DAYS
INSTEAD OF SEVEN; ON SUBSEQUENT OCCASIONS THEY WILL LAST ONLY FOR THREE
DAYS; AS THE HABIT RECURS, THE EARNINGS WILL LAST SCARCELY FOR A DAY;
AND FINALLY THEY WILL DISAPPEAR IN ONE NIGHT OF FEASTING.

OFTEN THERE ARE WIFE AND CHILDREN AT HOME. AND IN MANY CASES IT HAPPENS
THAT THESE BECOME INFECTED BY SUCH A WAY OF LIVING, ESPECIALLY IF THE
HUSBAND IS GOOD TO THEM AND WANTS TO DO THE BEST HE CAN FOR THEM AND
LOVES THEM IN HIS OWN WAY AND ACCORDING TO HIS OWN LIGHTS. THEN THE
WEEK'S EARNINGS ARE SPENT IN COMMON AT HOME WITHIN TWO OR THREE DAYS.
THE FAMILY EAT AND DRINK TOGETHER AS LONG AS THE MONEY LASTS AND AT THE
END OF THE WEEK THEY HUNGER TOGETHER. THEN THE WIFE WANDERS ABOUT
FURTIVELY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, BORROWS A LITTLE, AND RUNS UP SMALL
DEBTS WITH THE SHOPKEEPERS IN AN EFFORT TO PULL THROUGH THE LEAN DAYS
TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEK. THEY SIT DOWN TOGETHER TO THE MIDDAY MEAL
WITH ONLY MEAGRE FARE ON THE TABLE, AND OFTEN EVEN NOTHING TO EAT. THEY
WAIT FOR THE COMING PAYDAY, TALKING OF IT AND MAKING PLANS; AND WHILE
THEY ARE THUS HUNGRY THEY DREAM OF THE PLENTY THAT IS TO COME. AND SO
THE LITTLE CHILDREN BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH MISERY IN THEIR EARLY YEARS.

BUT THE EVIL CULMINATES WHEN THE HUSBAND GOES HIS OWN WAY FROM THE
BEGINNING OF THE WEEK AND THE WIFE PROTESTS, SIMPLY OUT OF LOVE FOR THE
CHILDREN. THEN THERE ARE QUARRELS AND BAD FEELING AND THE HUSBAND TAKES
TO DRINK ACCORDING AS HE BECOMES ESTRANGED FROM HIS WIFE. HE NOW BECOMES
DRUNK EVERY SATURDAY. FIGHTING FOR HER OWN EXISTENCE AND THAT OF THE
CHILDREN, THE WIFE HAS TO HOUND HIM ALONG THE ROAD FROM THE FACTORY TO
THE TAVERN IN ORDER TO GET A FEW SHILLINGS FROM HIM ON PAYDAY. THEN WHEN
HE FINALLY COMES HOME, MAYBE ON THE SUNDAY OR THE MONDAY, HAVING PARTED
WITH HIS LAST SHILLINGS AND PENCE, PITIABLE SCENES FOLLOW, SCENES THAT
CRY OUT FOR GOD'S MERCY.

I HAVE HAD ACTUAL EXPERIENCE OF ALL THIS IN HUNDREDS OF CASES. AT FIRST
I WAS DISGUSTED AND INDIGNANT; BUT LATER ON I CAME TO RECOGNIZE THE
WHOLE TRAGEDY OF THEIR MISFORTUNE AND TO UNDERSTAND THE PROFOUND CAUSES
OF IT. THEY WERE THE UNHAPPY VICTIMS OF EVIL CIRCUMSTANCES.

HOUSING CONDITIONS WERE VERY BAD AT THAT TIME. THE VIENNA MANUAL
LABOURERS LIVED IN SURROUNDINGS OF APPALLING MISERY. I SHUDDER EVEN
TO-DAY WHEN I THINK OF THE WOEFUL DENS IN WHICH PEOPLE DWELT, THE NIGHT
SHELTERS AND THE SLUMS, AND ALL THE TENEBROUS SPECTACLES OF ORDURE,
LOATHSOME FILTH AND WICKEDNESS.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN ONE DAY WHEN HORDES OF EMANCIPATED SLAVES COME FORTH
FROM THESE DENS OF MISERY TO SWOOP DOWN ON THEIR UNSUSPECTING FELLOW
MEN? FOR THIS OTHER WORLD DOES NOT THINK ABOUT SUCH A POSSIBILITY. THEY
HAVE ALLOWED THESE THINGS TO GO ON WITHOUT CARING AND EVEN WITHOUT
SUSPECTING--IN THEIR TOTAL LACK OF INSTINCTIVE UNDERSTANDING--THAT
SOONER OR LATER DESTINY WILL TAKE ITS VENGEANCE UNLESS IT WILL HAVE BEEN
APPEASED IN TIME.

TO-DAY I FERVIDLY THANK PROVIDENCE FOR HAVING SENT ME TO SUCH A SCHOOL.
THERE I COULD NOT REFUSE TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN MATTERS THAT DID NOT
PLEASE ME. THIS SCHOOL SOON TAUGHT ME A PROFOUND LESSON.

IN ORDER NOT TO DESPAIR COMPLETELY OF THE PEOPLE AMONG WHOM I THEN LIVED
I HAD TO SET ON ONE SIDE THE OUTWARD APPEARANCES OF THEIR LIVES AND ON
THE OTHER THE REASONS WHY THEY HAD DEVELOPED IN THAT WAY. THEN I COULD
HEAR EVERYTHING WITHOUT DISCOURAGEMENT; FOR THOSE WHO EMERGED FROM ALL
THIS MISFORTUNE AND MISERY, FROM THIS FILTH AND OUTWARD DEGRADATION,
WERE NOT HUMAN BEINGS AS SUCH BUT RATHER LAMENTABLE RESULTS OF
LAMENTABLE LAWS. IN MY OWN LIFE SIMILAR HARDSHIPS PREVENTED ME FROM
GIVING WAY TO A PITYING SENTIMENTALITY AT THE SIGHT OF THESE DEGRADED
PRODUCTS WHICH HAD FINALLY RESULTED FROM THE PRESSURE OF CIRCUMSTANCES.
NO, THE SENTIMENTAL ATTITUDE WOULD BE THE WRONG ONE TO ADOPT.

EVEN IN THOSE DAYS I ALREADY SAW THAT THERE WAS A TWO-FOLD METHOD BY
WHICH ALONE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO BRING ABOUT AN AMELIORATION OF THESE
CONDITIONS. THIS METHOD IS: FIRST, TO CREATE BETTER FUNDAMENTAL
CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT BY ESTABLISHING A PROFOUND FEELING FOR
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES AMONG THE PUBLIC; SECOND, TO COMBINE THIS
FEELING FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES WITH A RUTHLESS DETERMINATION TO
PRUNE AWAY ALL EXCRESCENCES WHICH ARE INCAPABLE OF BEING IMPROVED.

JUST AS NATURE CONCENTRATES ITS GREATEST ATTENTION, NOT TO THE
MAINTENANCE OF WHAT ALREADY EXISTS BUT ON THE SELECTIVE BREEDING OF
OFFSPRING IN ORDER TO CARRY ON THE SPECIES, SO IN HUMAN LIFE ALSO IT IS
LESS A MATTER OF ARTIFICIALLY IMPROVING THE EXISTING GENERATION--WHICH,
OWING TO HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS, IS IMPOSSIBLE IN NINETY-NINE CASES OUT
OF A HUNDRED--AND MORE A MATTER OF SECURING FROM THE VERY START A BETTER
ROAD FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.

DURING MY STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE IN VIENNA I PERCEIVED VERY CLEARLY THAT
THE AIM OF ALL SOCIAL ACTIVITY MUST NEVER BE MERELY CHARITABLE RELIEF,
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS AND USELESS, BUT IT MUST RATHER BE A MEANS TO FIND A
WAY OF ELIMINATING THE FUNDAMENTAL DEFICIENCIES IN OUR ECONOMIC AND
CULTURAL LIFE--DEFICIENCIES WHICH NECESSARILY BRING ABOUT THE
DEGRADATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR AT LEAST LEAD HIM TOWARDS SUCH
DEGRADATION. THE DIFFICULTY OF EMPLOYING EVERY MEANS, EVEN THE MOST
DRASTIC, TO ERADICATE THE HOSTILITY PREVAILING AMONG THE WORKING CLASSES
TOWARDS THE STATE IS LARGELY DUE TO AN ATTITUDE OF UNCERTAINTY IN
DECIDING UPON THE INNER MOTIVES AND CAUSES OF THIS CONTEMPORARY
PHENOMENON. THE GROUNDS OF THIS UNCERTAINTY ARE TO BE FOUND EXCLUSIVELY
IN THE SENSE OF GUILT WHICH EACH INDIVIDUAL FEELS FOR HAVING PERMITTED
THIS TRAGEDY OF DEGRADATION. FOR THAT FEELING PARALYSES EVERY EFFORT AT
MAKING A SERIOUS AND FIRM DECISION TO ACT. AND THUS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE
WHOM IT CONCERNS ARE VACILLATING THEY ARE TIMID AND HALF-HEARTED IN
PUTTING INTO EFFECT EVEN THE MEASURES WHICH ARE INDISPENSABLE FOR
SELF-PRESERVATION. WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL IS NO LONGER BURDENED WITH HIS
OWN CONSCIOUSNESS OF BLAME IN THIS REGARD, THEN AND ONLY THEN WILL HE
HAVE THAT INNER TRANQUILLITY AND OUTER FORCE TO CUT OFF DRASTICALLY AND
RUTHLESSLY ALL THE PARASITE GROWTH AND ROOT OUT THE WEEDS.

BUT BECAUSE THE AUSTRIAN STATE HAD ALMOST NO SENSE OF SOCIAL RIGHTS OR
SOCIAL LEGISLATION ITS INABILITY TO ABOLISH THOSE EVIL EXCRESCENCES WAS
MANIFEST.

I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT APPALLED ME MOST AT THAT TIME: THE
ECONOMIC MISERY OF THOSE WHO WERE THEN MY COMPANIONS, THEIR CRUDE
CUSTOMS AND MORALS, OR THE LOW LEVEL OF THEIR INTELLECTUAL CULTURE.

HOW OFTEN OUR BOURGEOISIE RISES UP IN MORAL INDIGNATION ON HEARING FROM
THE MOUTH OF SOME PITIABLE TRAMP THAT IT IS ALL THE SAME TO HIM WHETHER
HE BE A GERMAN OR NOT AND THAT HE WILL FIND HIMSELF AT HOME WHEREVER HE
CAN GET ENOUGH TO KEEP BODY AND SOUL TOGETHER. THEY PROTEST STERNLY
AGAINST SUCH A LACK OF 'NATIONAL PRIDE' AND STRONGLY EXPRESS THEIR
HORROR AT SUCH SENTIMENTS.

BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE REALLY ASK THEMSELVES WHY IT IS THAT THEIR OWN
SENTIMENTS ARE BETTER? HOW MANY OF THEM UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR NATURAL
PRIDE IN BEING MEMBERS OF SO FAVOURED A NATION ARISES FROM THE
INNUMERABLE SUCCESSION OF INSTANCES THEY HAVE ENCOUNTERED WHICH REMIND
THEM OF THE GREATNESS OF THE FATHERLAND AND THE NATION IN ALL SPHERES OF
ARTISTIC AND CULTURAL LIFE? HOW MANY OF THEM REALIZE THAT PRIDE IN THE
FATHERLAND IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON KNOWLEDGE OF ITS GREATNESS IN ALL
THOSE SPHERES? DO OUR BOURGEOIS CIRCLES EVER THINK WHAT A RIDICULOUSLY
MEAGRE SHARE THE PEOPLE HAVE IN THAT KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS A NECESSARY
PREREQUISITE FOR THE FEELING OF PRIDE IN ONE'S FATHERLAND?

IT CANNOT BE OBJECTED HERE THAT IN OTHER COUNTRIES SIMILAR CONDITIONS
EXIST AND THAT NEVERTHELESS THE WORKING CLASSES IN THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE
REMAINED PATRIOTIC. EVEN IF THAT WERE SO, IT WOULD BE NO EXCUSE FOR OUR
NEGLIGENT ATTITUDE. BUT IT IS NOT SO. WHAT WE CALL CHAUVINISTIC
EDUCATION--IN THE CASE OF THE FRENCH PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE--IS ONLY THE
EXCESSIVE EXALTATION OF THE GREATNESS OF FRANCE IN ALL SPHERES OF
CULTURE OR, AS THE FRENCH SAY, CIVILIZATION. THE FRENCH BOY IS NOT
EDUCATED ON PURELY OBJECTIVE PRINCIPLES. WHEREVER THE IMPORTANCE OF THE
POLITICAL AND CULTURAL GREATNESS OF HIS COUNTRY IS CONCERNED HE IS
TAUGHT IN THE MOST SUBJECTIVE WAY THAT ONE CAN IMAGINE.

THIS EDUCATION WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO BE CONFINED TO GENERAL IDEAS IN A
LARGE PERSPECTIVE AND THESE OUGHT TO BE DEEPLY ENGRAVEN, BY CONSTANT
REPETITION IF NECESSARY, ON THE MEMORIES AND FEELINGS OF THE PEOPLE.

IN OUR CASE, HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT MERELY GUILTY OF NEGATIVE SINS OF
OMISSION BUT ALSO OF POSITIVELY PERVERTING THE LITTLE WHICH SOME
INDIVIDUALS HAD THE LUCK TO LEARN AT SCHOOL. THE RATS THAT POISON OUR
BODY-POLITIC GNAW FROM THE HEARTS AND MEMORIES OF THE BROAD MASSES EVEN
THAT LITTLE WHICH DISTRESS AND MISERY HAVE LEFT.

LET THE READER TRY TO PICTURE THE FOLLOWING:

THERE IS A LODGING IN A CELLAR AND THIS LODGING CONSISTS OF TWO DAMP
ROOMS. IN THESE ROOMS A WORKMAN AND HIS FAMILY LIVE--SEVEN PEOPLE IN
ALL. LET US ASSUME THAT ONE OF THE CHILDREN IS A BOY OF THREE YEARS.
THAT IS THE AGE AT WHICH CHILDREN FIRST BECOME CONSCIOUS OF THE
IMPRESSIONS WHICH THEY RECEIVE. IN THE CASE OF HIGHLY GIFTED PEOPLE
TRACES OF THE IMPRESSIONS RECEIVED IN THOSE EARLY YEARS LAST IN THE
MEMORY UP TO AN ADVANCED AGE. NOW THE NARROWNESS AND CONGESTION OF THOSE
LIVING QUARTERS DO NOT CONDUCE TO PLEASANT INTER-RELATIONS. THUS
QUARRELS AND FITS OF MUTUAL ANGER ARISE. THESE PEOPLE CAN HARDLY BE SAID
TO LIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER, BUT RATHER DOWN ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER. THE
SMALL MISUNDERSTANDINGS WHICH DISAPPEAR OF THEMSELVES IN A HOME WHERE
THERE IS ENOUGH SPACE FOR PEOPLE TO GO APART FROM ONE ANOTHER FOR A
WHILE, HERE BECOME THE SOURCE OF CHRONIC DISPUTES. AS FAR AS THE
CHILDREN ARE CONCERNED THE SITUATION IS TOLERABLE FROM THIS POINT OF
VIEW. IN SUCH CONDITIONS THEY ARE CONSTANTLY QUARRELLING WITH ONE
ANOTHER, BUT THE QUARRELS ARE QUICKLY AND ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN. BUT WHEN
THE PARENTS FALL OUT WITH ONE ANOTHER THESE DAILY BICKERINGS OFTEN
DESCEND TO RUDENESS SUCH AS CANNOT BE ADEQUATELY IMAGINED. THE RESULTS
OF SUCH EXPERIENCES MUST BECOME APPARENT LATER ON IN THE CHILDREN. ONE
MUST HAVE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE OF SUCH A MILIEU SO AS TO BE ABLE TO
PICTURE THE STATE OF AFFAIRS THAT ARISES FROM THESE MUTUAL
RECRIMINATIONS WHEN THE FATHER PHYSICALLY ASSAULTS THE MOTHER AND
MALTREATS HER IN A FIT OF DRUNKEN RAGE. AT THE AGE OF SIX THE CHILD CAN
NO LONGER IGNORE THOSE SORDID DETAILS WHICH EVEN AN ADULT WOULD FIND
REVOLTING. INFECTED WITH MORAL POISON, BODILY UNDERNOURISHED, AND THE
POOR LITTLE HEAD FILLED WITH VERMIN, THE YOUNG 'CITIZEN' GOES TO THE
PRIMARY SCHOOL. WITH DIFFICULTY HE BARELY LEARNS TO READ AND WRITE.
THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF LEARNING ANY LESSONS AT HOME. QUITE THE
CONTRARY. THE FATHER AND MOTHER THEMSELVES TALK BEFORE THE CHILDREN IN
THE MOST DISPARAGING WAY ABOUT THE TEACHER AND THE SCHOOL AND THEY ARE
MUCH MORE INCLINED TO INSULT THE TEACHERS THAN TO PUT THEIR OFFSPRING
ACROSS THE KNEE AND KNOCK SOUND REASON INTO HIM. WHAT THE LITTLE FELLOW
HEARS AT HOME DOES NOT TEND TO INCREASE RESPECT FOR HIS HUMAN
SURROUNDINGS. HERE NOTHING GOOD IS SAID OF HUMAN NATURE AS A WHOLE AND
EVERY INSTITUTION, FROM THE SCHOOL TO THE GOVERNMENT, IS REVILED.
WHETHER RELIGION AND MORALS ARE CONCERNED OR THE STATE AND THE SOCIAL
ORDER, IT IS ALL THE SAME; THEY ARE ALL SCOFFED AT. WHEN THE YOUNG LAD
LEAVES SCHOOL, AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT
ARE THE MOST STRIKING FEATURES OF HIS CHARACTER, INCREDIBLE IGNORANCE IN
SO FAR AS REAL KNOWLEDGE IS CONCERNED OR CYNICAL IMPUDENCE COMBINED WITH
AN ATTITUDE TOWARDS MORALITY WHICH IS REALLY STARTLING AT SO YOUNG AN
AGE.

WHAT STATION IN LIFE CAN SUCH A PERSON FILL, TO WHOM NOTHING IS SACRED,
WHO HAS NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING NOBLE BUT, ON THE CONTRARY, HAS BEEN
INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH THE LOWEST KIND OF HUMAN EXISTENCE? THIS
CHILD OF THREE HAS GOT INTO THE HABIT OF REVILING ALL AUTHORITY BY THE
TIME HE IS FIFTEEN. HE HAS BEEN ACQUAINTED ONLY WITH MORAL FILTH AND
VILENESS, EVERYTHING BEING EXCLUDED THAT MIGHT STIMULATE HIS THOUGHT
TOWARDS HIGHER THINGS. AND NOW THIS YOUNG SPECIMEN OF HUMANITY ENTERS
THE SCHOOL OF LIFE.

HE LEADS THE SAME KIND OF LIFE WHICH WAS EXEMPLIFIED FOR HIM BY HIS
FATHER DURING HIS CHILDHOOD. HE LOITERS ABOUT AND COMES HOME AT ALL
HOURS. HE NOW EVEN BLACK-GUARDS THAT BROKEN-HEARTED BEING WHO GAVE HIM
BIRTH. HE CURSES GOD AND THE WORLD AND FINALLY ENDS UP IN A HOUSE OF
CORRECTION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. THERE HE GETS THE FINAL POLISH.

AND HIS BOURGEOIS CONTEMPORARIES ARE ASTONISHED AT THE LACK OF
'PATRIOTIC ENTHUSIASM' WHICH THIS YOUNG 'CITIZEN' MANIFESTS.

DAY AFTER DAY THE BOURGEOIS WORLD ARE WITNESSES TO THE PHENOMENON OF
SPREADING POISON AMONG THE PEOPLE THROUGH THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE
THEATRE AND THE CINEMA, GUTTER JOURNALISM AND OBSCENE BOOKS; AND YET
THEY ARE ASTONISHED AT THE DEPLORABLE 'MORAL STANDARDS' AND 'NATIONAL
INDIFFERENCE' OF THE MASSES. AS IF THE CINEMA BILGE AND THE GUTTER PRESS
AND SUCHLIKE COULD INCULCATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GREATNESS OF ONE'S
COUNTRY, APART ENTIRELY FROM THE EARLIER EDUCATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL.

I THEN CAME TO UNDERSTAND, QUICKLY AND THOROUGHLY, WHAT I HAD NEVER BEEN
AWARE OF BEFORE. IT WAS THE FOLLOWING:

THE QUESTION OF 'NATIONALIZING' A PEOPLE IS FIRST AND FOREMOST ONE OF
ESTABLISHING HEALTHY SOCIAL CONDITIONS WHICH WILL FURNISH THE GROUNDS
THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL. FOR ONLY WHEN
FAMILY UPBRINGING AND SCHOOL EDUCATION HAVE INCULCATED IN THE INDIVIDUAL
A KNOWLEDGE OF THE CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC AND, ABOVE ALL, THE POLITICAL
GREATNESS OF HIS OWN COUNTRY--THEN, AND THEN ONLY, WILL IT BE POSSIBLE
FOR HIM TO FEEL PROUD OF BEING A CITIZEN OF SUCH A COUNTRY. I CAN FIGHT
ONLY FOR SOMETHING THAT I LOVE. I CAN LOVE ONLY WHAT I RESPECT. AND IN
ORDER TO RESPECT A THING I MUST AT LEAST HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE OF IT.

AS SOON AS MY INTEREST IN SOCIAL QUESTIONS WAS ONCE AWAKENED I BEGAN TO
STUDY THEM IN A FUNDAMENTAL WAY. A NEW AND HITHERTO UNKNOWN WORLD WAS
THUS REVEALED TO ME.

IN THE YEARS 1909-10 I HAD SO FAR IMPROVED MY, POSITION THAT I NO LONGER
HAD TO EARN MY DAILY BREAD AS A MANUAL LABOURER. I WAS NOW WORKING
INDEPENDENTLY AS DRAUGHTSMAN, AND PAINTER IN WATER COLOURS. THIS MÃ‰TIER
WAS A POOR ONE INDEED AS FAR AS EARNINGS WERE CONCERNED; FOR THESE WERE
ONLY SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE BARE EXIGENCIES OF LIFE. YET IT HAD AN
INTEREST FOR ME IN VIEW OF THE PROFESSION TO WHICH I ASPIRED. MOREOVER,
WHEN I CAME HOME IN THE EVENINGS I WAS NOW NO LONGER DEAD-TIRED AS
FORMERLY, WHEN I USED TO BE UNABLE TO LOOK INTO A BOOK WITHOUT FALLING
ASLEEP ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. MY PRESENT OCCUPATION THEREFORE WAS IN LINE
WITH THE PROFESSION I AIMED AT FOR THE FUTURE. MOREOVER, I WAS MASTER OF
MY OWN TIME AND COULD DISTRIBUTE MY WORKING-HOURS NOW BETTER THAN
FORMERLY. I PAINTED IN ORDER TO EARN MY BREAD, AND I STUDIED BECAUSE I
LIKED IT.

THUS I WAS ABLE TO ACQUIRE THAT THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE SOCIAL
PROBLEM WHICH WAS A NECESSARY COMPLEMENT TO WHAT I WAS LEARNING THROUGH
ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. I STUDIED ALL THE BOOKS WHICH I COULD FIND THAT DEALT
WITH THIS QUESTION AND I THOUGHT DEEPLY ON WHAT I READ. I THINK THAT THE
MILIEU IN WHICH I THEN LIVED CONSIDERED ME AN ECCENTRIC PERSON.

BESIDES MY INTEREST IN THE SOCIAL QUESTION I NATURALLY DEVOTED MYSELF
WITH ENTHUSIASM TO THE STUDY OF ARCHITECTURE. SIDE BY SIDE WITH MUSIC, I
CONSIDERED IT QUEEN OF THE ARTS. TO STUDY IT WAS FOR ME NOT WORK BUT
PLEASURE. I COULD READ OR DRAW UNTIL THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
WITHOUT EVER GETTING TIRED. AND I BECAME MORE AND MORE CONFIDENT THAT MY
DREAM OF A BRILLIANT FUTURE WOULD BECOME TRUE, EVEN THOUGH I SHOULD HAVE
TO WAIT LONG YEARS FOR ITS FULFILMENT. I WAS FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT ONE
DAY I SHOULD MAKE A NAME FOR MYSELF AS AN ARCHITECT.

THE FACT THAT, SIDE BY SIDE WITH MY PROFESSIONAL STUDIES, I TOOK THE
GREATEST INTEREST IN EVERYTHING THAT HAD TO DO WITH POLITICS DID NOT
SEEM TO ME TO SIGNIFY ANYTHING OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. ON THE CONTRARY: I
LOOKED UPON THIS PRACTICAL INTEREST IN POLITICS MERELY AS PART OF AN
ELEMENTARY OBLIGATION THAT DEVOLVES ON EVERY THINKING MAN. THOSE WHO
HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OF THE POLITICAL WORLD AROUND THEM HAVE NO RIGHT
TO CRITICIZE OR COMPLAIN. ON POLITICAL QUESTIONS THEREFORE I STILL
CONTINUED TO READ AND STUDY A GREAT DEAL. BUT READING HAD PROBABLY A
DIFFERENT SIGNIFICANCE FOR ME FROM THAT WHICH IT HAS FOR THE AVERAGE RUN
OF OUR SO-CALLED 'INTELLECTUALS'.

I KNOW PEOPLE WHO READ INTERMINABLY, BOOK AFTER BOOK, FROM PAGE TO PAGE,
AND YET I SHOULD NOT CALL THEM 'WELL-READ PEOPLE'. OF COURSE THEY 'KNOW'
AN IMMENSE AMOUNT; BUT THEIR BRAIN SEEMS INCAPABLE OF ASSORTING AND
CLASSIFYING THE MATERIAL WHICH THEY HAVE GATHERED FROM BOOKS. THEY HAVE
NOT THE FACULTY OF DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN WHAT IS USEFUL AND USELESS IN
A BOOK; SO THAT THEY MAY RETAIN THE FORMER IN THEIR MINDS AND IF
POSSIBLE SKIP OVER THE LATTER WHILE READING IT, IF THAT BE NOT POSSIBLE,
THEN--WHEN ONCE READ--THROW IT OVERBOARD AS USELESS BALLAST. READING IS
NOT AN END IN ITSELF, BUT A MEANS TO AN END. ITS CHIEF PURPOSE IS TO
HELP TOWARDS FILLING IN THE FRAMEWORK WHICH IS MADE UP OF THE TALENTS
AND CAPABILITIES THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL POSSESSES. THUS EACH ONE PROCURES
FOR HIMSELF THE IMPLEMENTS AND MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR THE FULFILMENT OF
HIS CALLING IN LIFE, NO MATTER WHETHER THIS BE THE ELEMENTARY TASK OF
EARNING ONE'S DAILY BREAD OR A CALLING THAT RESPONDS TO HIGHER HUMAN
ASPIRATIONS. SUCH IS THE FIRST PURPOSE OF READING. AND THE SECOND
PURPOSE IS TO GIVE A GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE. IN
BOTH CASES, HOWEVER, THE MATERIAL WHICH ONE HAS ACQUIRED THROUGH READING
MUST NOT BE STORED UP IN THE MEMORY ON A PLAN THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE
SUCCESSIVE CHAPTERS OF THE BOOK; BUT EACH LITTLE PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE THUS
GAINED MUST BE TREATED AS IF IT WERE A LITTLE STONE TO BE INSERTED INTO
A MOSAIC, SO THAT IT FINDS ITS PROPER PLACE AMONG ALL THE OTHER PIECES
AND PARTICLES THAT HELP TO FORM A GENERAL WORLD-PICTURE IN THE BRAIN OF
THE READER. OTHERWISE ONLY A CONFUSED JUMBLE OF CHAOTIC NOTIONS WILL
RESULT FROM ALL THIS READING. THAT JUMBLE IS NOT MERELY USELESS, BUT IT
ALSO TENDS TO MAKE THE UNFORTUNATE POSSESSOR OF IT CONCEITED. FOR HE
SERIOUSLY CONSIDERS HIMSELF A WELL-EDUCATED PERSON AND THINKS THAT HE
UNDERSTANDS SOMETHING OF LIFE. HE BELIEVES THAT HE HAS ACQUIRED
KNOWLEDGE, WHEREAS THE TRUTH IS THAT EVERY INCREASE IN SUCH 'KNOWLEDGE'
DRAWS HIM MORE AND MORE AWAY FROM REAL LIFE, UNTIL HE FINALLY ENDS UP IN
SOME SANATORIUM OR TAKES TO POLITICS AND BECOMES A PARLIAMENTARY DEPUTY.

SUCH A PERSON NEVER SUCCEEDS IN TURNING HIS KNOWLEDGE TO PRACTICAL
ACCOUNT WHEN THE OPPORTUNE MOMENT ARRIVES; FOR HIS MENTAL EQUIPMENT IS
NOT ORDERED WITH A VIEW TO MEETING THE DEMANDS OF EVERYDAY LIFE. HIS
KNOWLEDGE IS STORED IN HIS BRAIN AS A LITERAL TRANSCRIPT OF THE BOOKS HE
HAS READ AND THE ORDER OF SUCCESSION IN WHICH HE HAS READ THEM. AND IF
FATE SHOULD ONE DAY CALL UPON HIM TO USE SOME OF HIS BOOK-KNOWLEDGE FOR
CERTAIN PRACTICAL ENDS IN LIFE THAT VERY CALL WILL HAVE TO NAME THE BOOK
AND GIVE THE NUMBER OF THE PAGE; FOR THE POOR NOODLE HIMSELF WOULD NEVER
BE ABLE TO FIND THE SPOT WHERE HE GATHERED THE INFORMATION NOW CALLED
FOR. BUT IF THE PAGE IS NOT MENTIONED AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT THE
WIDELY-READ INTELLECTUAL WILL FIND HIMSELF IN A STATE OF HOPELESS
EMBARRASSMENT. IN A HIGH STATE OF AGITATION HE SEARCHES FOR ANALOGOUS
CASES AND IT IS ALMOST A DEAD CERTAINTY THAT HE WILL FINALLY DELIVER THE
WRONG PRESCRIPTION.

IF THAT IS NOT A CORRECT DESCRIPTION, THEN HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN THE
POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF OUR PARLIAMENTARY HEROES WHO HOLD THE HIGHEST
POSITIONS IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY? OTHERWISE WE SHOULD HAVE TO
ATTRIBUTE THE DOINGS OF SUCH POLITICAL LEADERS, NOT TO PATHOLOGICAL
CONDITIONS BUT SIMPLY TO MALICE AND CHICANERY.

ON THE OTHER HAND, ONE WHO HAS CULTIVATED THE ART OF READING WILL
INSTANTLY DISCERN, IN A BOOK OR JOURNAL OR PAMPHLET, WHAT OUGHT TO BE
REMEMBERED BECAUSE IT MEETS ONE'S PERSONAL NEEDS OR IS OF VALUE AS
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE. WHAT HE THUS LEARNS IS INCORPORATED IN HIS MENTAL
ANALOGUE OF THIS OR THAT PROBLEM OR THING, FURTHER CORRECTING THE MENTAL
PICTURE OR ENLARGING IT SO THAT IT BECOMES MORE EXACT AND PRECISE.
SHOULD SOME PRACTICAL PROBLEM SUDDENLY DEMAND EXAMINATION OR SOLUTION,
MEMORY WILL IMMEDIATELY SELECT THE OPPORTUNE INFORMATION FROM THE MASS
THAT HAS BEEN ACQUIRED THROUGH YEARS OF READING AND WILL PLACE THIS
INFORMATION AT THE SERVICE OF ONE'S POWERS OF JUDGMENT SO AS TO GET A
NEW AND CLEARER VIEW OF THE PROBLEM IN QUESTION OR PRODUCE A DEFINITIVE
SOLUTION.

ONLY THUS CAN READING HAVE ANY MEANING OR BE WORTH WHILE.

THE SPEAKER, FOR EXAMPLE, WHO HAS NOT THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION READY
TO HAND WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO A PROPER TREATMENT OF HIS SUBJECT IS
UNABLE TO DEFEND HIS OPINIONS AGAINST AN OPPONENT, EVEN THOUGH THOSE
OPINIONS BE PERFECTLY SOUND AND TRUE. IN EVERY DISCUSSION HIS MEMORY
WILL LEAVE HIM SHAMEFULLY IN THE LURCH. HE CANNOT SUMMON UP ARGUMENTS TO
SUPPORT HIS STATEMENTS OR TO REFUTE HIS OPPONENT. SO LONG AS THE SPEAKER
HAS ONLY TO DEFEND HIMSELF ON HIS OWN PERSONAL ACCOUNT, THE SITUATION IS
NOT SERIOUS; BUT THE EVIL COMES WHEN CHANCE PLACES AT THE HEAD OF PUBLIC
AFFAIRS SUCH A SOI-DISANT KNOW-IT-ALL, WHO IN REALITY KNOWS NOTHING.

FROM EARLY YOUTH I ENDEAVOURED TO READ BOOKS IN THE RIGHT WAY AND I WAS
FORTUNATE IN HAVING A GOOD MEMORY AND INTELLIGENCE TO ASSIST ME. FROM
THAT POINT OF VIEW MY SOJOURN IN VIENNA WAS PARTICULARLY USEFUL AND
PROFITABLE. MY EXPERIENCES OF EVERYDAY LIFE THERE WERE A CONSTANT
STIMULUS TO STUDY THE MOST DIVERSE PROBLEMS FROM NEW ANGLES. INASMUCH AS
I WAS IN A POSITION TO PUT THEORY TO THE TEST OF REALITY AND REALITY TO
THE TEST OF THEORY, I WAS SAFE FROM THE DANGER OF PEDANTIC THEORIZING ON
THE ONE HAND AND, ON THE OTHER, FROM BEING TOO IMPRESSED BY THE
SUPERFICIAL ASPECTS OF REALITY.

THE EXPERIENCE OF EVERYDAY LIFE AT THAT TIME DETERMINED ME TO MAKE A
FUNDAMENTAL THEORETICAL STUDY OF TWO MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OUTSIDE OF
THE SOCIAL QUESTION.

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHEN I MIGHT HAVE STARTED TO MAKE A THOROUGH
STUDY OF THE DOCTRINE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF MARXISM WERE IT NOT FOR THE
FACT THAT I THEN LITERALLY RAN HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE PROBLEM.

WHAT I KNEW OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY IN MY YOUTH WAS PRECIOUS LITTLE AND THAT
LITTLE WAS FOR THE MOST PART WRONG. THE FACT THAT IT LED THE STRUGGLE
FOR UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE AND THE SECRET BALLOT GAVE ME AN INNER
SATISFACTION; FOR MY REASON THEN TOLD ME THAT THIS WOULD WEAKEN THE
HABSBURG REGIME, WHICH I SO THOROUGHLY DETESTED. I WAS CONVINCED THAT
EVEN IF IT SHOULD SACRIFICE THE GERMAN ELEMENT THE DANUBIAN STATE COULD
NOT CONTINUE TO EXIST. EVEN AT THE PRICE OF A LONG AND SLOW SLAVIZ-ATION
OF THE AUSTRIAN GERMANS THE STATE WOULD SECURE NO GUARANTEE OF A REALLY
DURABLE EMPIRE; BECAUSE IT WAS VERY QUESTIONABLE IF AND HOW FAR THE
SLAVS POSSESSED THE NECESSARY CAPACITY FOR CONSTRUCTIVE POLITICS.
THEREFORE I WELCOMED EVERY MOVEMENT THAT MIGHT LEAD TOWARDS THE FINAL
DISRUPTION OF THAT IMPOSSIBLE STATE WHICH HAD DECREED THAT IT WOULD
STAMP OUT THE GERMAN CHARACTER IN TEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. THE MORE THIS
BABEL OF TONGUES WROUGHT DISCORD AND DISRUPTION, EVEN IN THE PARLIAMENT,
THE NEARER THE HOUR APPROACHED FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF THIS BABYLONIAN
EMPIRE. THAT WOULD MEAN THE LIBERATION OF MY GERMAN AUSTRIAN PEOPLE, AND
ONLY THEN WOULD IT BECOME POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO BE RE-UNITED TO THE
MOTHERLAND.

ACCORDINGLY I HAD NO FEELINGS OF ANTIPATHY TOWARDS THE ACTUAL POLICY OF
THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS. THAT ITS AVOWED PURPOSE WAS TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF
THE WORKING CLASSES--WHICH IN MY IGNORANCE I THEN FOOLISHLY
BELIEVED--WAS A FURTHER REASON WHY I SHOULD SPEAK IN FAVOUR OF SOCIAL
DEMOCRACY RATHER THAN AGAINST IT. BUT THE FEATURES THAT CONTRIBUTED MOST
TO ESTRANGE ME FROM THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT WAS ITS HOSTILE
ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE STRUGGLE FOR THE CONSERVATION OF GERMANISM IN
AUSTRIA, ITS LAMENTABLE COCOTTING WITH THE SLAV 'COMRADES', WHO RECEIVED
THESE APPROACHES FAVOURABLY AS LONG AS ANY PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES WERE
FORTHCOMING BUT OTHERWISE MAINTAINED A HAUGHTY RESERVE, THUS GIVING THE
IMPORTUNATE MENDICANTS THE SORT OF ANSWER THEIR BEHAVIOUR DESERVED.

AND SO AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN THE WORD 'MARXISM' WAS VERY LITTLE KNOWN
TO ME, WHILE I LOOKED ON 'SOCIAL DEMOCRACY' AND 'SOCIALISM' AS
SYNONYMOUS EXPRESSIONS. IT WAS ONLY AS THE RESULT OF A SUDDEN BLOW FROM
THE ROUGH HAND OF FATE THAT MY EYES WERE OPENED TO THE NATURE OF THIS
UNPARALLELED SYSTEM FOR DUPING THE PUBLIC.

HITHERTO MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY WAS ONLY THAT
OF A MERE SPECTATOR AT SOME OF THEIR MASS MEETINGS. I HAD NOT THE
SLIGHTEST IDEA OF THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC TEACHING OR THE MENTALITY OF ITS
PARTISANS. ALL OF A SUDDEN I WAS BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH THE PRODUCTS
OF THEIR TEACHING AND WHAT THEY CALLED THEIR WELTANSCHAUUNG. IN THIS
WAY A FEW MONTHS SUFFICED FOR ME TO LEARN SOMETHING WHICH UNDER OTHER
CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT HAVE NECESSITATED DECADES OF STUDY--NAMELY, THAT
UNDER THE CLOAK OF SOCIAL VIRTUE AND LOVE OF ONE'S NEIGHBOUR A VERITABLE
PESTILENCE WAS SPREADING ABROAD AND THAT IF THIS PESTILENCE BE NOT
STAMPED OUT OF THE WORLD WITHOUT DELAY IT MAY EVENTUALLY SUCCEED IN
EXTERMINATING THE HUMAN RACE.

I FIRST CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS WHILE WORKING IN THE
BUILDING TRADE.

FROM THE VERY TIME THAT I STARTED WORK THE SITUATION WAS NOT VERY
PLEASANT FOR ME. MY CLOTHES WERE STILL RATHER DECENT. I WAS CAREFUL OF
MY SPEECH AND I WAS RESERVED IN MANNER. I WAS SO OCCUPIED WITH THINKING
OF MY OWN PRESENT LOT AND FUTURE POSSIBILITIES THAT I DID NOT TAKE MUCH
OF AN INTEREST IN MY IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS. I HAD SOUGHT WORK SO THAT I
SHOULDN'T STARVE AND AT THE SAME TIME SO AS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE FURTHER
HEADWAY WITH MY STUDIES, THOUGH THIS HEADWAY MIGHT BE SLOW. POSSIBLY I
SHOULD NOT HAVE BOTHERED TO BE INTERESTED IN MY COMPANIONS WERE IT NOT
THAT ON THE THIRD OR FOURTH DAY AN EVENT OCCURRED WHICH FORCED ME TO
TAKE A DEFINITE STAND. I WAS ORDERED TO JOIN THE TRADE UNION.

AT THAT TIME I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE TRADES UNIONS. I HAD HAD NO
OPPORTUNITY OF FORMING AN OPINION ON THEIR UTILITY OR INUTILITY, AS THE
CASE MIGHT BE. BUT WHEN I WAS TOLD THAT I MUST JOIN THE UNION I REFUSED.
THE GROUNDS WHICH I GAVE FOR MY REFUSAL WERE SIMPLY THAT I KNEW NOTHING
ABOUT THE MATTER AND THAT ANYHOW I WOULD NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO BE FORCED
INTO ANYTHING. PROBABLY THE FORMER REASON SAVED ME FROM BEING THROWN OUT
RIGHT AWAY. THEY PROBABLY THOUGHT THAT WITHIN A FEW DAYS I MIGHT BE
CONVERTED' AND BECOME MORE DOCILE. BUT IF THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE
PROFOUNDLY MISTAKEN. AFTER TWO WEEKS I FOUND IT UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR
ME TO TAKE SUCH A STEP, EVEN IF I HAD BEEN WILLING TO TAKE IT AT FIRST.
DURING THOSE FOURTEEN DAYS I CAME TO KNOW MY FELLOW WORKMEN BETTER, AND
NO POWER IN THE WORLD COULD HAVE MOVED ME TO JOIN AN ORGANIZATION WHOSE
REPRESENTATIVES HAD MEANWHILE SHOWN THEMSELVES IN A LIGHT WHICH I FOUND
SO UNFAVOURABLE.

DURING THE FIRST DAYS MY RESENTMENT WAS AROUSED.

AT MIDDAY SOME OF MY FELLOW WORKERS USED TO ADJOURN TO THE NEAREST
TAVERN, WHILE THE OTHERS REMAINED ON THE BUILDING PREMISES AND THERE ATE
THEIR MIDDAY MEAL, WHICH IN MOST CASES WAS A VERY SCANTY ONE. THESE WERE
MARRIED MEN. THEIR WIVES BROUGHT THEM THE MIDDAY SOUP IN DILAPIDATED
VESSELS. TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEK THERE WAS A GRADUAL INCREASE IN THE
NUMBER OF THOSE WHO REMAINED TO EAT THEIR MIDDAY MEAL ON THE BUILDING
PREMISES. I UNDERSTOOD THE REASON FOR THIS AFTERWARDS. THEY NOW TALKED
POLITICS.

I DRANK MY BOTTLE OF MILK AND ATE MY MORSEL OF BREAD SOMEWHERE ON THE
OUTSKIRTS, WHILE I CIRCUMSPECTLY STUDIED MY ENVIRONMENT OR ELSE FELL TO
MEDITATING ON MY OWN HARSH LOT. YET I HEARD MORE THAN ENOUGH. AND I
OFTEN THOUGHT THAT SOME OF WHAT THEY SAID WAS MEANT FOR MY EARS, IN THE
HOPE OF BRINGING ME TO A DECISION. BUT ALL THAT I HEARD HAD THE EFFECT
OF AROUSING THE STRONGEST ANTAGONISM IN ME. EVERYTHING WAS
DISPARAGED--THE NATION, BECAUSE IT WAS HELD TO BE AN INVENTION OF THE
'CAPITALIST' CLASS (HOW OFTEN I HAD TO LISTEN TO THAT PHRASE!); THE
FATHERLAND, BECAUSE IT WAS HELD TO BE AN INSTRUMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE
BOURGEOISIE FOR THE EXPLOITATION OF' THE WORKING MASSES; THE AUTHORITY
OF THE LAW, BECAUSE THAT WAS A MEANS OF HOLDING DOWN THE PROLETARIAT;
RELIGION, AS A MEANS OF DOPING THE PEOPLE, SO AS TO EXPLOIT THEM
AFTERWARDS; MORALITY, AS A BADGE OF STUPID AND SHEEPISH DOCILITY. THERE
WAS NOTHING THAT THEY DID NOT DRAG IN THE MUD.

AT FIRST I REMAINED SILENT; BUT THAT COULD NOT LAST VERY LONG. THEN I
BEGAN TO TAKE PART IN THE DISCUSSION AND TO REPLY TO THEIR STATEMENTS. I
HAD TO RECOGNIZE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS WAS BOUND TO BE ENTIRELY FRUITLESS,
AS LONG AS I DID NOT HAVE AT LEAST A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DEFINITE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE DISCUSSED. SO I DECIDED TO
CONSULT THE SOURCE FROM WHICH MY INTERLOCUTORS CLAIMED TO HAVE DRAWN
THEIR SO-CALLED WISDOM. I DEVOURED BOOK AFTER BOOK, PAMPHLET AFTER
PAMPHLET.

MEANWHILE, WE ARGUED WITH ONE ANOTHER ON THE BUILDING PREMISES. FROM DAY
TO DAY I WAS BECOMING BETTER INFORMED THAN MY COMPANIONS IN THE SUBJECTS
ON WHICH THEY CLAIMED TO BE EXPERTS. THEN A DAY CAME WHEN THE MORE
REDOUBTABLE OF MY ADVERSARIES RESORTED TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPON THEY
HAD TO REPLACE THE FORCE OF REASON. THIS WAS INTIMIDATION AND PHYSICAL
FORCE. SOME OF THE LEADERS AMONG MY ADVERSARIES ORDERED ME TO LEAVE THE
BUILDING OR ELSE GET FLUNG DOWN FROM THE SCAFFOLDING. AS I WAS QUITE
ALONE I COULD NOT PUT UP ANY PHYSICAL RESISTANCE; SO I CHOSE THE FIRST
ALTERNATIVE AND DEPARTED, RICHER HOWEVER BY AN EXPERIENCE.

I WENT AWAY FULL OF DISGUST; BUT AT THE SAME TIME SO DEEPLY MOVED THAT
IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TURN MY BACK ON THE WHOLE SITUATION
AND THINK NO MORE ABOUT IT. WHEN MY ANGER BEGAN TO CALM DOWN THE SPIRIT
OF OBSTINACY GOT THE UPPER HAND AND I DECIDED THAT AT ALL COSTS I WOULD
GET BACK TO WORK AGAIN IN THE BUILDING TRADE. THIS DECISION BECAME ALL
THE STRONGER A FEW WEEKS LATER, WHEN MY LITTLE SAVINGS HAD ENTIRELY RUN
OUT AND HUNGER CLUTCHED ME ONCE AGAIN IN ITS MERCILESS ARMS. NO
ALTERNATIVE WAS LEFT TO ME. I GOT WORK AGAIN AND HAD TO LEAVE IT FOR THE
SAME REASONS AS BEFORE.

THEN I ASKED MYSELF: ARE THESE MEN WORTHY OF BELONGING TO A GREAT
PEOPLE? THE QUESTION WAS PROFOUNDLY DISTURBING; FOR IF THE ANSWER WERE
'YES', THEN THE STRUGGLE TO DEFEND ONE'S NATIONALITY IS NO LONGER WORTH
ALL THE TROUBLE AND SACRIFICE WE DEMAND OF OUR BEST ELEMENTS IF IT BE IN
THE INTERESTS OF SUCH A RABBLE. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THE ANSWER HAD TO
BE 'NO--THESE MEN ARE NOT WORTHY OF THE NATION', THEN OUR NATION IS POOR
INDEED IN MEN. DURING THOSE DAYS OF MENTAL ANGUISH AND DEEP MEDITATION I
SAW BEFORE MY MIND THE EVER-INCREASING AND MENACING ARMY OF PEOPLE WHO
COULD NO LONGER BE RECKONED AS BELONGING TO THEIR OWN NATION.

IT WAS WITH QUITE A DIFFERENT FEELING, SOME DAYS LATER, THAT I GAZED ON
THE INTERMINABLE RANKS, FOUR ABREAST, OF VIENNESE WORKMEN PARADING AT A
MASS DEMONSTRATION. I STOOD DUMBFOUNDED FOR ALMOST TWO HOURS, WATCHING
THAT ENORMOUS HUMAN DRAGON WHICH SLOWLY UNCOILED ITSELF THERE BEFORE ME.
WHEN I FINALLY LEFT THE SQUARE AND WANDERED IN THE DIRECTION OF MY
LODGINGS I FELT DISMAYED AND DEPRESSED. ON MY WAY I NOTICED THE
ARBEITERZEITUNG (THE WORKMAN'S JOURNAL) IN A TOBACCO SHOP. THIS WAS THE
CHIEF PRESS-ORGAN OF THE OLD AUSTRIAN SOCIAL DEMOCRACY. IN A CHEAP CAFÃ©,
WHERE THE COMMON PEOPLE USED TO FOREGATHER AND WHERE I OFTEN WENT TO
READ THE PAPERS, THE ARBEITERZEITUNG WAS ALSO DISPLAYED. BUT HITHERTO I
COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO DO MORE THAN GLANCE AT THE WRETCHED THING FOR
A COUPLE OF MINUTES: FOR ITS WHOLE TONE WAS A SORT OF MENTAL VITRIOL TO
ME. UNDER THE DEPRESSING INFLUENCE OF THE DEMONSTRATION I HAD WITNESSED,
SOME INTERIOR VOICE URGED ME TO BUY THE PAPER IN THAT TOBACCO SHOP AND
READ IT THROUGH. SO I BROUGHT IT HOME WITH ME AND SPENT THE WHOLE
EVENING READING IT, DESPITE THE STEADILY MOUNTING RAGE PROVOKED BY THIS
CEASELESS OUTPOURING OF FALSEHOODS.

I NOW FOUND THAT IN THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC DAILY PAPERS I COULD STUDY THE
INNER CHARACTER OF THIS POLITICO-PHILOSOPHIC SYSTEM MUCH BETTER THAN IN
ALL THEIR THEORETICAL LITERATURE.

FOR THERE WAS A STRIKING DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE TWO. IN THE LITERARY
EFFUSIONS WHICH DEALT WITH THE THEORY OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY THERE WAS A
DISPLAY OF HIGH-SOUNDING PHRASEOLOGY ABOUT LIBERTY AND HUMAN DIGNITY AND
BEAUTY, ALL PROMULGATED WITH AN AIR OF PROFOUND WISDOM AND SERENE
PROPHETIC ASSURANCE; A METICULOUSLY-WOVEN GLITTER OF WORDS TO DAZZLE AND
MISLEAD THE READER. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE DAILY PRESS INCULCATED THIS
NEW DOCTRINE OF HUMAN REDEMPTION IN THE MOST BRUTAL FASHION. NO MEANS
WERE TOO BASE, PROVIDED THEY COULD BE EXPLOITED IN THE CAMPAIGN OF
SLANDER. THESE JOURNALISTS WERE REAL VIRTUOSOS IN THE ART OF TWISTING
FACTS AND PRESENTING THEM IN A DECEPTIVE FORM. THE THEORETICAL
LITERATURE WAS INTENDED FOR THE SIMPLETONS OF THE SOI-DISANT
INTELLECTUALS BELONGING TO THE MIDDLE AND, NATURALLY, THE UPPER CLASSES.
THE NEWSPAPER PROPAGANDA WAS INTENDED FOR THE MASSES.

THIS PROBING INTO BOOKS AND NEWSPAPERS AND STUDYING THE TEACHINGS OF
SOCIAL DEMOCRACY REAWAKENED MY LOVE FOR MY OWN PEOPLE. AND THUS WHAT AT
FIRST SEEMED AN IMPASSABLE CHASM BECAME THE OCCASION OF A CLOSER
AFFECTION.

HAVING ONCE UNDERSTOOD THE WORKING OF THE COLOSSAL SYSTEM FOR POISONING
THE POPULAR MIND, ONLY A FOOL COULD BLAME THE VICTIMS OF IT. DURING THE
YEARS THAT FOLLOWED I BECAME MORE INDEPENDENT AND, AS I DID SO, I BECAME
BETTER ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE INNER CAUSE OF THE SUCCESS ACHIEVED BY
THIS SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC GOSPEL. I NOW REALIZED THE MEANING AND PURPOSE OF
THOSE BRUTAL ORDERS WHICH PROHIBITED THE READING OF ALL BOOKS AND
NEWSPAPERS THAT WERE NOT 'RED' AND AT THE SAME TIME DEMANDED THAT ONLY
THE 'RED' MEETINGS SHOULD BE ATTENDED. IN THE CLEAR LIGHT OF BRUTAL
REALITY I WAS ABLE TO SEE WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE INEVITABLE
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT INTOLERANT TEACHING.

THE PSYCHE OF THE BROAD MASSES IS ACCESSIBLE ONLY TO WHAT IS STRONG AND
UNCOMPROMISING. LIKE A WOMAN WHOSE INNER SENSIBILITIES ARE NOT SO MUCH
UNDER THE SWAY OF ABSTRACT REASONING BUT ARE ALWAYS SUBJECT TO THE
INFLUENCE OF A VAGUE EMOTIONAL LONGING FOR THE STRENGTH THAT COMPLETES
HER BEING, AND WHO WOULD RATHER BOW TO THE STRONG MAN THAN DOMINATE THE
WEAKLING--IN LIKE MANNER THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE PREFER THE RULER TO
THE SUPPLIANT AND ARE FILLED WITH A STRONGER SENSE OF MENTAL SECURITY BY
A TEACHING THAT BROOKS NO RIVAL THAN BY A TEACHING WHICH OFFERS THEM A
LIBERAL CHOICE. THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE IDEA OF HOW TO MAKE SUCH A CHOICE
AND THUS THEY ARE PRONE TO FEEL THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABANDONED. THEY FEEL
VERY LITTLE SHAME AT BEING TERRORIZED INTELLECTUALLY AND THEY ARE
SCARCELY CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THEIR FREEDOM AS HUMAN BEINGS IS
IMPUDENTLY ABUSED; AND THUS THEY HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF THE
INTRINSIC FALLACY OF THE WHOLE DOCTRINE. THEY SEE ONLY THE RUTHLESS
FORCE AND BRUTALITY OF ITS DETERMINED UTTERANCES, TO WHICH THEY ALWAYS
SUBMIT.

IF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY SHOULD BE OPPOSED BY A MORE TRUTHFUL TEACHING, THEN
EVEN, THOUGH THE STRUGGLE BE OF THE BITTEREST KIND, THIS TRUTHFUL
TEACHING WILL FINALLY PREVAIL PROVIDED IT BE ENFORCED WITH EQUAL
RUTHLESSNESS.

WITHIN LESS THAN TWO YEARS I HAD GAINED A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIAL
DEMOCRACY, IN ITS TEACHING AND THE TECHNIQUE OF ITS OPERATIONS.

I RECOGNIZED THE INFAMY OF THAT TECHNIQUE WHEREBY THE MOVEMENT CARRIED
ON A CAMPAIGN OF MENTAL TERRORISM AGAINST THE BOURGEOISIE, WHO ARE
NEITHER MORALLY NOR SPIRITUALLY EQUIPPED TO WITHSTAND SUCH ATTACKS. THE
TACTICS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY CONSISTED IN OPENING, AT A GIVEN SIGNAL, A
VERITABLE DRUM-FIRE OF LIES AND CALUMNIES AGAINST THE MAN WHOM THEY
BELIEVED TO BE THE MOST REDOUBTABLE OF THEIR ADVERSARIES, UNTIL THE
NERVES OF THE LATTER GAVE WAY AND THEY SACRIFICED THE MAN WHO WAS
ATTACKED, SIMPLY IN THE HOPE OF BEING ALLOWED TO LIVE IN PEACE. BUT THE
HOPE PROVED ALWAYS TO BE A FOOLISH ONE, FOR THEY WERE NEVER LEFT IN
PEACE.

THE SAME TACTICS ARE REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN, UNTIL FEAR OF THESE MAD
DOGS EXERCISES, THROUGH SUGGESTION, A PARALYSING EFFECT ON THEIR
VICTIMS.

THROUGH ITS OWN EXPERIENCE SOCIAL DEMOCRACY LEARNED THE VALUE OF
STRENGTH, AND FOR THAT REASON IT ATTACKS MOSTLY THOSE IN WHOM IT SCENTS
STUFF OF THE MORE STALWART KIND, WHICH IS INDEED A VERY RARE POSSESSION.
ON THE OTHER HAND IT PRAISES EVERY WEAKLING AMONG ITS ADVERSARIES, MORE
OR LESS CAUTIOUSLY, ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE OF HIS MENTAL QUALITIES
KNOWN OR PRESUMED. THEY HAVE LESS FEAR OF A MAN OF GENIUS WHO LACKS
WILL-POWER THAN OF A VIGOROUS CHARACTER WITH MEDIOCRE INTELLIGENCE AND
AT THE SAME TIME THEY HIGHLY COMMEND THOSE WHO ARE DEVOID OF
INTELLIGENCE AND WILL-POWER.

THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS KNOW HOW TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY ALONE
ARE THE PROTECTORS OF PEACE. IN THIS WAY, ACTING VERY CIRCUMSPECTLY BUT
NEVER LOSING SIGHT OF THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL, THEY CONQUER ONE POSITION
AFTER ANOTHER, AT ONE TIME BY METHODS OF QUIET INTIMIDATION AND AT
ANOTHER TIME BY SHEER DAYLIGHT ROBBERY, EMPLOYING THESE LATTER TACTICS
AT THOSE MOMENTS WHEN PUBLIC ATTENTION IS TURNED TOWARDS OTHER MATTERS
FROM WHICH IT DOES NOT WISH TO BE DIVERTED, OR WHEN THE PUBLIC CONSIDERS
AN INCIDENT TOO TRIVIAL TO CREATE A SCANDAL ABOUT IT AND THUS PROVOKE
THE ANGER OF A MALIGNANT OPPONENT.

THESE TACTICS ARE BASED ON AN ACCURATE ESTIMATION OF HUMAN FRAILTIES AND
MUST LEAD TO SUCCESS, WITH ALMOST MATHEMATICAL CERTAINTY, UNLESS THE
OTHER SIDE ALSO LEARNS HOW TO FIGHT POISON GAS WITH POISON GAS. THE
WEAKER NATURES MUST BE TOLD THAT HERE IT IS A CASE OF TO BE OR NOT TO
BE.

I ALSO CAME TO UNDERSTAND THAT PHYSICAL INTIMIDATION HAS ITS
SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE MASS AS WELL AS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL. HERE AGAIN THE
SOCIALISTS HAD CALCULATED ACCURATELY ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT.

INTIMIDATION IN WORKSHOPS AND IN FACTORIES, IN ASSEMBLY HALLS AND AT
MASS DEMONSTRATIONS, WILL ALWAYS MEET WITH SUCCESS AS LONG AS IT DOES
NOT HAVE TO ENCOUNTER THE SAME KIND OF TERROR IN A STRONGER FORM.

THEN OF COURSE THE PARTY WILL RAISE A HORRIFIED OUTCRY, YELLING BLUE
MURDER AND APPEALING TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE, WHICH THEY HAVE JUST
REPUDIATED. IN DOING THIS THEIR AIM GENERALLY IS TO ADD TO THE GENERAL
CONFUSION, SO THAT THEY MAY HAVE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY OF REACHING THEIR
OWN GOAL UNOBSERVED. THEIR IDEA IS TO FIND AMONG THE HIGHER GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS SOME BOVINE CREATURE WHO, IN THE STUPID HOPE THAT HE MAY WIN
THE GOOD GRACES OF THESE AWE-INSPIRING OPPONENTS SO THAT THEY MAY
REMEMBER HIM IN CASE OF FUTURE EVENTUALITIES, WILL HELP THEM NOW TO
BREAK ALL THOSE WHO MAY OPPOSE THIS WORLD PEST.

THE IMPRESSION WHICH SUCH SUCCESSFUL TACTICS MAKE ON THE MINDS OF THE
BROAD MASSES, WHETHER THEY BE ADHERENTS OR OPPONENTS, CAN BE ESTIMATED
ONLY BY ONE WHO KNOWS THE POPULAR MIND, NOT FROM BOOKS BUT FROM
PRACTICAL LIFE. FOR THE SUCCESSES WHICH ARE THUS OBTAINED ARE TAKEN BY
THE ADHERENTS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY AS A TRIUMPHANT SYMBOL OF THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THEIR OWN CAUSE; ON THE OTHER HAND THE BEATEN OPPONENT
VERY OFTEN LOSES FAITH IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY FURTHER RESISTANCE.

THE MORE I UNDERSTOOD THE METHODS OF PHYSICAL INTIMIDATION THAT WERE
EMPLOYED, THE MORE SYMPATHY I HAD FOR THE MULTITUDE THAT HAD SUCCUMBED
TO IT.

I AM THANKFUL NOW FOR THE ORDEAL WHICH I HAD TO GO THROUGH AT THAT TIME;
FOR IT WAS THE MEANS OF BRINGING ME TO THINK KINDLY AGAIN OF MY OWN
PEOPLE, INASMUCH AS THE EXPERIENCE ENABLED ME TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE
FALSE LEADERS AND THE VICTIMS WHO HAVE BEEN LED ASTRAY.

WE MUST LOOK UPON THE LATTER SIMPLY AS VICTIMS. I HAVE JUST NOW TRIED TO
DEPICT A FEW TRAITS WHICH EXPRESS THE MENTALITY OF THOSE ON THE LOWEST
RUNG OF THE SOCIAL LADDER; BUT MY PICTURE WOULD BE DISPROPORTIONATE IF I
DO NOT ADD THAT AMID THE SOCIAL DEPTHS I STILL FOUND LIGHT; FOR I
EXPERIENCED A RARE SPIRIT OF SELF-SACRIFICE AND LOYAL COMRADESHIP AMONG
THOSE MEN, WHO DEMANDED LITTLE FROM LIFE AND WERE CONTENT AMID THEIR
MODEST SURROUNDINGS. THIS WAS TRUE ESPECIALLY OF THE OLDER GENERATION OF
WORKMEN. AND ALTHOUGH THESE QUALITIES WERE DISAPPEARING MORE AND MORE IN
THE YOUNGER GENERATION, OWING TO THE ALL-PERVADING INFLUENCE OF THE BIG
CITY, YET AMONG THE YOUNGER GENERATION ALSO THERE WERE MANY WHO WERE
SOUND AT THE CORE AND WHO WERE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEMSELVES
UNCONTAMINATED AMID THE SORDID SURROUNDINGS OF THEIR EVERYDAY EXISTENCE.
IF THESE MEN, WHO IN MANY CASES MEANT WELL AND WERE UPRIGHT IN
THEMSELVES, GAVE THE SUPPORT TO THE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES CARRIED ON BY
THE COMMON ENEMIES OF OUR PEOPLE, THAT WAS BECAUSE THOSE DECENT
WORKPEOPLE DID NOT AND COULD NOT GRASP THE DOWNRIGHT INFAMY OF THE
DOCTRINE TAUGHT BY THE SOCIALIST AGITATORS. FURTHERMORE, IT WAS BECAUSE
NO OTHER SECTION OF THE COMMUNITY BOTHERED ITSELF ABOUT THE LOT OF THE
WORKING CLASSES. FINALLY, THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS BECAME SUCH THAT MEN WHO
OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE ACTED DIFFERENTLY WERE FORCED TO SUBMIT TO THEM,
EVEN THOUGH UNWILLINGLY AT FIRST. A DAY CAME WHEN POVERTY GAINED THE
UPPER HAND AND DROVE THOSE WORKMEN INTO THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC RANKS.

ON INNUMERABLE OCCASIONS THE BOURGEOISIE TOOK A DEFINITE STAND AGAINST
EVEN THE MOST LEGITIMATE HUMAN DEMANDS OF THE WORKING CLASSES. THAT
CONDUCT WAS ILL-JUDGED AND INDEED IMMORAL AND COULD BRING NO GAIN
WHATSOEVER TO THE BOURGEOIS CLASS. THE RESULT WAS THAT THE HONEST
WORKMAN ABANDONED THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT OF THE TRADES UNION ORGANIZATION
AND WAS DRAGGED INTO POLITICS.

THERE WERE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF WORKMEN WHO BEGAN BY BEING HOSTILE
TO THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY; BUT THEIR DEFENCES WERE REPEATEDLY
STORMED AND FINALLY THEY HAD TO SURRENDER. YET THIS DEFEAT WAS DUE TO
THE STUPIDITY OF THE BOURGEOIS PARTIES, WHO HAD OPPOSED EVERY SOCIAL
DEMAND PUT FORWARD BY THE WORKING CLASS. THE SHORT-SIGHTED REFUSAL TO
MAKE AN EFFORT TOWARDS IMPROVING LABOUR CONDITIONS, THE REFUSAL TO ADOPT
MEASURES WHICH WOULD INSURE THE WORKMAN IN CASE OF ACCIDENTS IN THE
FACTORIES, THE REFUSAL TO FORBID CHILD LABOUR, THE REFUSAL TO CONSIDER
PROTECTIVE MEASURES FOR FEMALE WORKERS, ESPECIALLY EXPECTANT
MOTHERS--ALL THIS WAS OF ASSISTANCE TO THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADERS,
WHO WERE THANKFUL FOR EVERY OPPORTUNITY WHICH THEY COULD EXPLOIT FOR
FORCING THE MASSES INTO THEIR NET. OUR BOURGEOIS PARTIES CAN NEVER
REPAIR THE DAMAGE THAT RESULTED FROM THE MISTAKE THEY THEN MADE. FOR
THEY SOWED THE SEEDS OF HATRED WHEN THEY OPPOSED ALL EFFORTS AT SOCIAL
REFORM. AND THUS THEY GAVE, AT LEAST, APPARENT GROUNDS TO JUSTIFY THE
CLAIM PUT FORWARD BY THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS--NAMELY, THAT THEY ALONE STAND
UP FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE WORKING CLASS.

AND THIS BECAME THE PRINCIPAL GROUND FOR THE MORAL JUSTIFICATION OF THE
ACTUAL EXISTENCE OF THE TRADES UNIONS, SO THAT THE LABOUR ORGANIZATION
BECAME FROM THAT TIME ONWARDS THE CHIEF POLITICAL RECRUITING GROUND TO
SWELL THE RANKS OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

WHILE THUS STUDYING THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS AROUND ME I WAS FORCED,
WHETHER I LIKED IT OR NOT, TO DECIDE ON THE ATTITUDE I SHOULD TAKE
TOWARDS THE TRADES UNIONS. BECAUSE I LOOKED UPON THEM AS INSEPARABLE
FROM THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, MY DECISION WAS HASTY--AND MISTAKEN. I
REPUDIATED THEM AS A MATTER OF COURSE. BUT ON THIS ESSENTIAL QUESTION
ALSO FATE INTERVENED AND GAVE ME A LESSON, WITH THE RESULT THAT I
CHANGED THE OPINION WHICH I HAD FIRST FORMED.

WHEN I WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD I HAD LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE
TRADES UNION AS A MEANS OF DEFENDING THE SOCIAL RIGHTS OF THE EMPLOYEES
AND FIGHTING FOR BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS FOR THEM AND, ON THE OTHER
HAND, THE TRADES UNION AS A POLITICAL INSTRUMENT USED BY THE PARTY IN
THE CLASS STRUGGLE.

THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS UNDERSTOOD THE ENORMOUS IMPORTANCE OF THE TRADES
UNION MOVEMENT. THEY APPROPRIATED IT AS AN INSTRUMENT AND USED IT WITH
SUCCESS, WHILE THE BOURGEOIS PARTIES FAILED TO UNDERSTAND IT AND THUS
LOST THEIR POLITICAL PRESTIGE. THEY THOUGHT THAT THEIR OWN ARROGANT VETO
WOULD ARREST THE LOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE MOVEMENT AND FORCE IT INTO
AN ILLOGICAL POSITION. BUT IT IS ABSURD AND ALSO UNTRUE TO SAY THAT THE
TRADES UNION MOVEMENT IS IN ITSELF HOSTILE TO THE NATION. THE OPPOSITE
IS THE MORE CORRECT VIEW. IF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE TRADES UNION ARE
DIRECTED TOWARDS IMPROVING THE CONDITION OF A CLASS, AND SUCCEED IN
DOING SO, SUCH ACTIVITIES ARE NOT AGAINST THE FATHERLAND OR THE STATE
BUT ARE, IN THE TRUEST SENSE OF THE WORD, NATIONAL. IN THAT WAY THE
TRADES UNION ORGANIZATION HELPS TO CREATE THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS WHICH
ARE INDISPENSABLE IN A GENERAL SYSTEM OF NATIONAL EDUCATION. IT DESERVES
HIGH RECOGNITION WHEN IT DESTROYS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL GERMS
OF SOCIAL DISEASE AND THUS FOSTERS THE GENERAL WELFARE OF THE NATION.

IT IS SUPERFLUOUS TO ASK WHETHER THE TRADES UNION IS INDISPENSABLE.

SO LONG AS THERE ARE EMPLOYERS WHO ATTACK SOCIAL UNDERSTANDING AND HAVE
WRONG IDEAS OF JUSTICE AND FAIR PLAY IT IS NOT ONLY THE RIGHT BUT ALSO
THE DUTY OF THEIR EMPLOYEES--WHO ARE, AFTER ALL, AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR
PEOPLE--TO PROTECT THE GENERAL INTERESTS AGAINST THE GREED AND UNREASON
OF THE INDIVIDUAL. FOR TO SAFEGUARD THE LOYALTY AND CONFIDENCE OF THE
PEOPLE IS AS MUCH IN THE INTERESTS OF THE NATION AS TO SAFEGUARD PUBLIC
HEALTH.

BOTH ARE SERIOUSLY MENACED BY DISHONOURABLE EMPLOYERS WHO ARE NOT
CONSCIOUS OF THEIR DUTY AS MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COMMUNITY. THEIR
PERSONAL AVIDITY OR IRRESPONSIBILITY SOWS THE SEEDS OF FUTURE TROUBLE.
TO ELIMINATE THE CAUSES OF SUCH A DEVELOPMENT IS AN ACTION THAT SURELY
DESERVES WELL OF THE COUNTRY.

IT MUST NOT BE ANSWERED HERE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WORKMAN IS FREE AT ANY
TIME TO ESCAPE FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN INJUSTICE WHICH HE HAS
ACTUALLY SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF AN EMPLOYER, OR WHICH HE THINKS HE HAS
SUFFERED--IN OTHER WORDS, HE CAN LEAVE. NO. THAT ARGUMENT IS ONLY A RUSE
TO DETRACT ATTENTION FROM THE QUESTION AT ISSUE. IS IT, OR IS IT NOT, IN
THE INTERESTS OF THE NATION TO REMOVE THE CAUSES OF SOCIAL UNREST? IF IT
IS, THEN THE FIGHT MUST BE CARRIED ON WITH THE ONLY WEAPONS THAT PROMISE
SUCCESS. BUT THE INDIVIDUAL WORKMAN IS NEVER IN A POSITION TO STAND UP
AGAINST THE MIGHT OF THE BIG EMPLOYER; FOR THE QUESTION HERE IS NOT ONE
THAT CONCERNS THE TRIUMPH OF RIGHT. IF IN SUCH A RELATION RIGHT HAD BEEN
RECOGNIZED AS THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE, THEN THE CONFLICT COULD NOT HAVE
ARISEN AT ALL. BUT HERE IT IS A QUESTION OF WHO IS THE STRONGER. IF THE
CASE WERE OTHERWISE, THE SENTIMENT OF JUSTICE ALONE WOULD SOLVE THE
DISPUTE IN AN HONOURABLE WAY; OR, TO PUT THE CASE MORE CORRECTLY,
MATTERS WOULD NOT HAVE COME TO SUCH A DISPUTE AT ALL.

NO. IF UNSOCIAL AND DISHONOURABLE TREATMENT OF MEN PROVOKES RESISTANCE,
THEN THE STRONGER PARTY CAN IMPOSE ITS DECISION IN THE CONFLICT UNTIL
THE CONSTITUTIONAL LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITIES DO AWAY WITH THE EVIL THROUGH
LEGISLATION. THEREFORE IT IS EVIDENT THAT IF THE INDIVIDUAL WORKMAN IS
TO HAVE ANY CHANCE AT ALL OF WINNING THROUGH IN THE STRUGGLE HE MUST BE
GROUPED WITH HIS FELLOW WORKMEN AND PRESENT A UNITED FRONT BEFORE THE
INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYER, WHO INCORPORATES IN HIS OWN PERSON THE MASSED
STRENGTH OF THE VESTED INTERESTS IN THE INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL
UNDERTAKING WHICH HE CONDUCTS.

THUS THE TRADES UNIONS CAN HOPE TO INCULCATE AND STRENGTHEN A SENSE OF
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN WORKADAY LIFE AND OPEN THE ROAD TO PRACTICAL
RESULTS. IN DOING THIS THEY TEND TO REMOVE THOSE CAUSES OF FRICTION
WHICH ARE A CONTINUAL SOURCE OF DISCONTENT AND COMPLAINT.

BLAME FOR THE FACT THAT THE TRADES UNIONS DO NOT FULFIL THIS
MUCH-DESIRED FUNCTION MUST BE LAID AT THE DOORS OF THOSE WHO BARRED THE
ROAD TO LEGISLATIVE SOCIAL REFORM, OR RENDERED SUCH A REFORM INEFFECTIVE
BY SABOTAGING IT THROUGH THEIR POLITICAL INFLUENCE.

THE POLITICAL BOURGEOISIE FAILED TO UNDERSTAND--OR, RATHER, THEY DID NOT
WISH TO UNDERSTAND--THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TRADES UNION MOVEMENT. THE
SOCIAL DEMOCRATS ACCORDINGLY SEIZED THE ADVANTAGE OFFERED THEM BY THIS
MISTAKEN POLICY AND TOOK THE LABOUR MOVEMENT UNDER THEIR EXCLUSIVE
PROTECTION, WITHOUT ANY PROTEST FROM THE OTHER SIDE. IN THIS WAY THEY
ESTABLISHED FOR THEMSELVES A SOLID BULWARK BEHIND WHICH THEY COULD
SAFELY RETIRE WHENEVER THE STRUGGLE ASSUMED A CRITICAL ASPECT. THUS THE
GENUINE PURPOSE OF THE MOVEMENT GRADUALLY FELL INTO OBLIVION, AND WAS
REPLACED BY NEW OBJECTIVES. FOR THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS NEVER TROUBLED
THEMSELVES TO RESPECT AND UPHOLD THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE
TRADE UNIONIST MOVEMENT WAS FOUNDED. THEY SIMPLY TOOK OVER THE MOVEMENT,
LOCK, STOCK AND BARREL, TO SERVE THEIR OWN POLITICAL ENDS.

WITHIN A FEW DECADES THE TRADES UNION MOVEMENT WAS TRANSFORMED, BY THE
EXPERT HAND OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY, FROM AN INSTRUMENT WHICH HAD BEEN
ORIGINALLY FASHIONED FOR THE DEFENCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS INTO AN INSTRUMENT
FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC STRUCTURE. THE INTERESTS OF
THE WORKING CLASS WERE NOT ALLOWED FOR A MOMENT TO CROSS THE PATH OF
THIS PURPOSE; FOR IN POLITICS THE APPLICATION OF ECONOMIC PRESSURE IS
ALWAYS POSSIBLE IF THE ONE SIDE BE SUFFICIENTLY UNSCRUPULOUS AND THE
OTHER SUFFICIENTLY INERT AND DOCILE. IN THIS CASE BOTH CONDITIONS WERE
FULFILLED.

BY THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENT CENTURY THE TRADES UNIONIST MOVEMENT HAD
ALREADY CEASED TO RECOGNIZE THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT HAD BEEN FOUNDED.
FROM YEAR TO YEAR IT FELL MORE AND MORE UNDER THE POLITICAL CONTROL OF
THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS, UNTIL IT FINALLY CAME TO BE USED AS A
BATTERING-RAM IN THE CLASS STRUGGLE. THE PLAN WAS TO SHATTER, BY MEANS
OF CONSTANTLY REPEATED BLOWS, THE ECONOMIC EDIFICE IN THE BUILDING OF
WHICH SO MUCH TIME AND CARE HAD BEEN EXPENDED. ONCE THIS OBJECTIVE HAD
BEEN REACHED, THE DESTRUCTION OF THE STATE WOULD BECOME A MATTER OF
COURSE, BECAUSE THE STATE WOULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF ITS
ECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS. ATTENTION TO THE REAL INTERESTS OF THE
WORKING-CLASSES, ON THE PART OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS, STEADILY DECREASED
UNTIL THE CUNNING LEADERS SAW THAT IT WOULD BE IN THEIR IMMEDIATE
POLITICAL INTERESTS IF THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL DEMANDS OF THE BROAD
MASSES REMAINED UNHEEDED; FOR THERE WAS A DANGER THAT IF THESE MASSES
ONCE FELT CONTENT THEY COULD NO LONGER BE EMPLOYED AS MERE PASSIVE
MATERIAL IN THE POLITICAL STRUGGLE.

THE GLOOMY PROSPECT WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF TO THE EYES OF THE
CONDOTTIERI OF THE CLASS WARFARE, IF THE DISCONTENT OF THE MASSES WERE
NO LONGER AVAILABLE AS A WAR WEAPON, CREATED SO MUCH ANXIETY AMONG THEM
THAT THEY SUPPRESSED AND OPPOSED EVEN THE MOST ELEMENTARY MEASURES OF
SOCIAL REFORM. AND CONDITIONS WERE SUCH THAT THOSE LEADERS DID NOT HAVE
TO TROUBLE ABOUT ATTEMPTING TO JUSTIFY SUCH AN ILLOGICAL POLICY.

AS THE MASSES WERE TAUGHT TO INCREASE AND HEIGHTEN THEIR DEMANDS THE
POSSIBILITY OF SATISFYING THEM DWINDLED AND WHATEVER AMELIORATIVE
MEASURES WERE TAKEN BECAME LESS AND LESS SIGNIFICANT; SO THAT IT WAS AT
THAT TIME POSSIBLE TO PERSUADE THE MASSES THAT THIS RIDICULOUS MEASURE
IN WHICH THE MOST SACRED CLAIMS OF THE WORKING-CLASSES WERE BEING
GRANTED REPRESENTED A DIABOLICAL PLAN TO WEAKEN THEIR FIGHTING POWER IN
THIS EASY WAY AND, IF POSSIBLE, TO PARALYSE IT. ONE WILL NOT BE
ASTONISHED AT THE SUCCESS OF THESE ALLEGATIONS IF ONE REMEMBERS WHAT A
SMALL MEASURE OF THINKING POWER THE BROAD MASSES POSSESS.

IN THE BOURGEOIS CAMP THERE WAS HIGH INDIGNATION OVER THE BAD FAITH OF
THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC TACTICS; BUT NOTHING WAS DONE TO DRAW A PRACTICAL
CONCLUSION AND ORGANIZE A COUNTER ATTACK FROM THE BOURGEOIS SIDE. THE
FEAR OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS, TO IMPROVE THE MISERABLE CONDITIONS OF THE
WORKING-CLASSES OUGHT TO HAVE INDUCED THE BOURGEOIS PARTIES TO MAKE THE
MOST ENERGETIC EFFORTS IN THIS DIRECTION AND THUS SNATCH FROM THE HANDS
OF THE CLASS-WARFARE LEADERS THEIR MOST IMPORTANT WEAPON; BUT NOTHING OF
THIS KIND HAPPENED.

INSTEAD OF ATTACKING THE POSITION OF THEIR ADVERSARIES THE BOURGEOISIE
ALLOWED ITSELF TO BE PRESSED AND HARRIED. FINALLY IT ADOPTED MEANS THAT
WERE SO TARDY AND SO INSIGNIFICANT THAT THEY WERE INEFFECTIVE AND WERE
REPUDIATED. SO THE WHOLE SITUATION REMAINED JUST AS IT HAD BEEN BEFORE
THE BOURGEOIS INTERVENTION; BUT THE DISCONTENT HAD THEREBY BECOME MORE
SERIOUS.

LIKE A THREATENING STORM, THE 'FREE TRADES UNION' HOVERED ABOVE THE
POLITICAL HORIZON AND ABOVE THE LIFE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL. IT WAS ONE OF
THE MOST FRIGHTFUL INSTRUMENTS OF TERROR THAT THREATENED THE SECURITY
AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC STRUCTURE, THE FOUNDATIONS OF
THE STATE AND THE LIBERTY OF THE INDIVIDUAL. ABOVE ALL, IT WAS THE 'FREE
TRADES UNION' THAT TURNED DEMOCRACY INTO A RIDICULOUS AND SCORNED
PHRASE, INSULTED THE IDEAL OF LIBERTY AND STIGMATIZED THAT OF FRATERNITY
WITH THE SLOGAN 'IF YOU WILL NOT BECOME OUR COMRADE WE SHALL CRACK YOUR
SKULL'.

IT WAS THUS THAT I THEN CAME TO KNOW THIS FRIEND OF HUMANITY. DURING THE
YEARS THAT FOLLOWED MY KNOWLEDGE OF IT BECAME WIDER AND DEEPER; BUT I
HAVE NEVER CHANGED ANYTHING IN THAT REGARD.

THE MORE I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH THE EXTERNAL FORMS OF SOCIAL
DEMOCRACY, THE GREATER BECAME MY DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND THE INNER NATURE
OF ITS DOCTRINES.

FOR THIS PURPOSE THE OFFICIAL LITERATURE OF THE PARTY COULD NOT HELP
VERY MUCH. IN DISCUSSING ECONOMIC QUESTIONS ITS STATEMENTS WERE FALSE
AND ITS PROOFS UNSOUND. IN TREATING OF POLITICAL AIMS ITS ATTITUDE WAS
INSINCERE. FURTHERMORE, ITS MODERN METHODS OF CHICANERY IN THE
PRESENTATION OF ITS ARGUMENTS WERE PROFOUNDLY REPUGNANT TO ME. ITS
FLAMBOYANT SENTENCES, ITS OBSCURE AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE PHRASES,
PRETENDED TO CONTAIN GREAT THOUGHTS, BUT THEY WERE DEVOID OF THOUGHT,
AND MEANINGLESS. ONE WOULD HAVE TO BE A DECADENT BOHEMIAN IN ONE OF OUR
MODERN CITIES IN ORDER TO FEEL AT HOME IN THAT LABYRINTH OF MENTAL
ABERRATION, SO THAT HE MIGHT DISCOVER 'INTIMATE EXPERIENCES' AMID THE
STINKING FUMES OF THIS LITERARY DADISM. THESE WRITERS WERE OBVIOUSLY
COUNTING ON THE PROVERBIAL HUMILITY OF A CERTAIN SECTION OF OUR PEOPLE,
WHO BELIEVE THAT A PERSON WHO IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE MUST BE PROFOUNDLY
WISE.

IN CONFRONTING THE THEORETICAL FALSITY AND ABSURDITY OF THAT DOCTRINE
WITH THE REALITY OF ITS EXTERNAL MANIFESTATIONS, I GRADUALLY CAME TO
HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF THE ENDS AT WHICH IT AIMED.

DURING SUCH MOMENTS I HAD DARK PRESENTIMENTS AND FEARED SOMETHING EVIL.
I HAD BEFORE ME A TEACHING INSPIRED BY EGOISM AND HATRED, MATHEMATICALLY
CALCULATED TO WIN ITS VICTORY, BUT THE TRIUMPH OF WHICH WOULD BE A
MORTAL BLOW TO HUMANITY.

MEANWHILE I HAD DISCOVERED THE RELATIONS EXISTING BETWEEN THIS
DESTRUCTIVE TEACHING AND THE SPECIFIC CHARACTER OF A PEOPLE, WHO UP TO
THAT TIME HAD BEEN TO ME ALMOST UNKNOWN.

KNOWLEDGE OF THE JEWS IS THE ONLY KEY WHEREBY ONE MAY UNDERSTAND THE
INNER NATURE AND THEREFORE THE REAL AIMS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY.

THE MAN WHO HAS COME TO KNOW THIS RACE HAS SUCCEEDED IN REMOVING FROM
HIS EYES THE VEIL THROUGH WHICH HE HAD SEEN THE AIMS AND MEANING OF HIS
PARTY IN A FALSE LIGHT; AND THEN, OUT OF THE MURK AND FOG OF SOCIAL
PHRASES RISES THE GRIMACING FIGURE OF MARXISM.

TO-DAY IT IS HARD AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY WHEN THE WORD
'JEW' FIRST BEGAN TO RAISE ANY PARTICULAR THOUGHT IN MY MIND. I DO NOT
REMEMBER EVEN HAVING HEARD THE WORD AT HOME DURING MY FATHER'S LIFETIME.
IF THIS NAME WERE MENTIONED IN A DEROGATORY SENSE I THINK THE OLD
GENTLEMAN WOULD JUST HAVE CONSIDERED THOSE WHO USED IT IN THIS WAY AS
BEING UNEDUCATED REACTIONARIES. IN THE COURSE OF HIS CAREER HE HAD COME
TO BE MORE OR LESS A COSMOPOLITAN, WITH STRONG VIEWS ON NATIONALISM,
WHICH HAD ITS EFFECT ON ME AS WELL. IN SCHOOL, TOO, I FOUND NO REASON TO
ALTER THE PICTURE OF THINGS I HAD FORMED AT HOME.

AT THE REALSCHULE I KNEW ONE JEWISH BOY. WE WERE ALL ON OUR GUARD IN OUR
RELATIONS WITH HIM, BUT ONLY BECAUSE HIS RETICENCE AND CERTAIN ACTIONS
OF HIS WARNED US TO BE DISCREET. BEYOND THAT MY COMPANIONS AND MYSELF
FORMED NO PARTICULAR OPINIONS IN REGARD TO HIM.

IT WAS NOT UNTIL I WAS FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS OLD THAT I FREQUENTLY
RAN UP AGAINST THE WORD 'JEW', PARTLY IN CONNECTION WITH POLITICAL
CONTROVERSIES. THESE REFERENCES AROUSED A SLIGHT AVERSION IN ME, AND I
COULD NOT AVOID AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING WHICH ALWAYS CAME OVER ME WHEN
I HAD TO LISTEN TO RELIGIOUS DISPUTES. BUT AT THAT TIME I HAD NO OTHER
FEELINGS ABOUT THE JEWISH QUESTION.

THERE WERE VERY FEW JEWS IN LINZ. IN THE COURSE OF CENTURIES THE JEWS
WHO LIVED THERE HAD BECOME EUROPEANIZED IN EXTERNAL APPEARANCE AND WERE
SO MUCH LIKE OTHER HUMAN BEINGS THAT I EVEN LOOKED UPON THEM AS GERMANS.
THE REASON WHY I DID NOT THEN PERCEIVE THE ABSURDITY OF SUCH AN ILLUSION
WAS THAT THE ONLY EXTERNAL MARK WHICH I RECOGNIZED AS DISTINGUISHING
THEM FROM US WAS THE PRACTICE OF THEIR STRANGE RELIGION. AS I THOUGHT
THAT THEY WERE PERSECUTED ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR FAITH MY AVERSION TO
HEARING REMARKS AGAINST THEM GREW ALMOST INTO A FEELING OF ABHORRENCE. I
DID NOT IN THE LEAST SUSPECT THAT THERE COULD BE SUCH A THING AS A
SYSTEMATIC ANTI-SEMITISM.

THEN I CAME TO VIENNA.

CONFUSED BY THE MASS OF IMPRESSIONS I RECEIVED FROM THE ARCHITECTURAL
SURROUNDINGS AND DEPRESSED BY MY OWN TROUBLES, I DID NOT AT FIRST
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SOCIAL STRATA OF WHICH THE POPULATION
OF THAT MAMMOTH CITY WAS COMPOSED. ALTHOUGH VIENNA THEN HAD ABOUT TWO
HUNDRED THOUSAND JEWS AMONG ITS POPULATION OF TWO MILLIONS, I DID NOT
NOTICE THEM. DURING THE FIRST WEEKS OF MY SOJOURN MY EYES AND MY MIND
WERE UNABLE TO COPE WITH THE ONRUSH OF NEW IDEAS AND VALUES. NOT UNTIL I
GRADUALLY SETTLED DOWN TO MY SURROUNDINGS, AND THE CONFUSED PICTURE
BEGAN TO GROW CLEARER, DID I ACQUIRE A MORE DISCRIMINATING VIEW OF MY
NEW WORLD. AND WITH THAT I CAME UP AGAINST THE JEWISH PROBLEM.

I WILL NOT SAY THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH I FIRST BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH
IT WAS PARTICULARLY UNPLEASANT FOR ME. IN THE JEW I STILL SAW ONLY A MAN
WHO WAS OF A DIFFERENT RELIGION, AND THEREFORE, ON GROUNDS OF HUMAN
TOLERANCE, I WAS AGAINST THE IDEA THAT HE SHOULD BE ATTACKED BECAUSE HE
HAD A DIFFERENT FAITH. AND SO I CONSIDERED THAT THE TONE ADOPTED BY THE
ANTI-SEMITIC PRESS IN VIENNA WAS UNWORTHY OF THE CULTURAL TRADITIONS OF
A GREAT PEOPLE. THE MEMORY OF CERTAIN EVENTS WHICH HAPPENED IN THE
MIDDLE AGES CAME INTO MY MIND, AND I FELT THAT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE
THEM REPEATED. GENERALLY SPEAKING, THESE ANTI-SEMITIC NEWSPAPERS DID NOT
BELONG TO THE FIRST RANK--BUT I DID NOT THEN UNDERSTAND THE REASON OF
THIS--AND SO I REGARDED THEM MORE AS THE PRODUCTS OF JEALOUSY AND ENVY
RATHER THAN THE EXPRESSION OF A SINCERE, THOUGH WRONG-HEADED, FEELING.

MY OWN OPINIONS WERE CONFIRMED BY WHAT I CONSIDERED TO BE THE INFINITELY
MORE DIGNIFIED MANNER IN WHICH THE REALLY GREAT PRESS REPLIED TO THOSE
ATTACKS OR SIMPLY IGNORED THEM, WHICH LATTER SEEMED TO ME THE MOST
RESPECTABLE WAY.

I DILIGENTLY READ WHAT WAS GENERALLY CALLED THE WORLD PRESS--NEUE FREIE
PRESSE, WIENER TAGEBLATT, ETC.--AND I WAS ASTONISHED BY THE ABUNDANCE OF
INFORMATION THEY GAVE THEIR READERS AND THE IMPARTIAL WAY IN WHICH THEY
PRESENTED PARTICULAR PROBLEMS. I APPRECIATED THEIR DIGNIFIED TONE; BUT
SOMETIMES THE FLAMBOYANCY OF THE STYLE WAS UNCONVINCING, AND I DID NOT
LIKE IT. BUT I ATTRIBUTED ALL THIS TO THE OVERPOWERING INFLUENCE OF THE
WORLD METROPOLIS.

SINCE I CONSIDERED VIENNA AT THAT TIME AS SUCH A WORLD METROPOLIS, I
THOUGHT THIS CONSTITUTED SUFFICIENT GROUNDS TO EXCUSE THESE SHORTCOMINGS
OF THE PRESS. BUT I WAS FREQUENTLY DISGUSTED BY THE GROVELLING WAY IN
WHICH THE VIENNA PRESS PLAYED LACKEY TO THE COURT. SCARCELY A MOVE TOOK
PLACE AT THE HOFBURG WHICH WAS NOT PRESENTED IN GLORIFIED COLOURS TO THE
READERS. IT WAS A FOOLISH PRACTICE, WHICH, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT HAD TO DO
WITH 'THE WISEST MONARCH OF ALL TIMES', REMINDED ONE ALMOST OF THE DANCE
WHICH THE MOUNTAIN COCK PERFORMS AT PAIRING TIME TO WOO HIS MATE. IT WAS
ALL EMPTY NONSENSE. AND I THOUGHT THAT SUCH A POLICY WAS A STAIN ON THE
IDEAL OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAY OF CURRYING FAVOUR
AT THE COURT WAS UNWORTHY OF THE PEOPLE. AND THAT WAS THE FIRST BLOT
THAT FELL ON MY APPRECIATION OF THE GREAT VIENNA PRESS.

WHILE IN VIENNA I CONTINUED TO FOLLOW WITH A VIVID INTEREST ALL THE
EVENTS THAT WERE TAKING PLACE IN GERMANY, WHETHER CONNECTED WITH
POLITICAL OR CULTURAL QUESTION. I HAD A FEELING OF PRIDE AND ADMIRATION
WHEN I COMPARED THE RISE OF THE YOUNG GERMAN EMPIRE WITH THE DECLINE OF
THE AUSTRIAN STATE. BUT, ALTHOUGH THE FOREIGN POLICY OF THAT EMPIRE WAS
A SOURCE OF REAL PLEASURE ON THE WHOLE, THE INTERNAL POLITICAL
HAPPENINGS WERE NOT ALWAYS SO SATISFACTORY. I DID NOT APPROVE OF THE
CAMPAIGN WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS BEING CARRIED ON AGAINST WILLIAM II. I
LOOKED UPON HIM NOT ONLY AS THE GERMAN EMPEROR BUT, ABOVE ALL, AS THE
CREATOR OF THE GERMAN NAVY. THE FACT THAT THE EMPEROR WAS PROHIBITED
FROM SPEAKING IN THE REICHSTAG MADE ME VERY ANGRY, BECAUSE THE
PROHIBITION CAME FROM A SIDE WHICH IN MY EYES HAD NO AUTHORITY TO MAKE
IT. FOR AT A SINGLE SITTING THOSE SAME PARLIAMENTARY GANDERS DID MORE
CACKLING TOGETHER THAN THE WHOLE DYNASTY OF EMPERORS, COMPRISING EVEN
THE WEAKEST, HAD DONE IN THE COURSE OF CENTURIES.

IT ANNOYED ME TO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN A NATION WHERE ANY
HALF-WITTED FELLOW COULD CLAIM FOR HIMSELF THE RIGHT TO CRITICIZE AND
MIGHT EVEN BE LET LOOSE ON THE PEOPLE AS A 'LEGISLATOR' IN THE
REICHSTAG, THE BEARER OF THE IMPERIAL CROWN COULD BE THE SUBJECT OF A
'REPRIMAND' ON THE PART OF THE MOST MISERABLE ASSEMBLY OF DRIVELLERS
THAT HAD EVER EXISTED.

I WAS EVEN MORE DISGUSTED AT THE WAY IN WHICH THIS SAME VIENNA PRESS
SALAAMED OBSEQUIOUSLY BEFORE THE MEANEST STEED BELONGING TO THE HABSBURG
ROYAL EQUIPAGE AND WENT OFF INTO WILD ECSTACIES OF DELIGHT IF THE NAG
WAGGED ITS TAIL IN RESPONSE. AND AT THE SAME TIME THESE NEWSPAPERS TOOK
UP AN ATTITUDE OF ANXIETY IN MATTERS THAT CONCERNED THE GERMAN EMPEROR,
TRYING TO CLOAK THEIR ENMITY BY THE SERIOUS AIR THEY GAVE THEMSELVES.
BUT IN MY EYES THAT ENMITY APPEARED TO BE ONLY POORLY CLOAKED. NATURALLY
THEY PROTESTED THAT THEY HAD NO INTENTION OF MIXING IN GERMANY'S
INTERNAL AFFAIRS--GOD FORBID! THEY PRETENDED THAT BY TOUCHING A DELICATE
SPOT IN SUCH A FRIENDLY WAY THEY WERE FULFILLING A DUTY THAT DEVOLVED
UPON THEM BY REASON OF THE MUTUAL ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AND
AT THE SAME TIME DISCHARGING THEIR OBLIGATIONS OF JOURNALISTIC
TRUTHFULNESS. HAVING THUS EXCUSED THEMSELVES ABOUT TENDERLY TOUCHING A
SORE SPOT, THEY BORED WITH THE FINGER RUTHLESSLY INTO THE WOUND.

THAT SORT OF THING MADE MY BLOOD BOIL. AND NOW I BEGAN TO BE MORE AND
MORE ON MY GUARD WHEN READING THE GREAT VIENNA PRESS.

I HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE, HOWEVER, THAT ON SUCH SUBJECTS ONE OF THE
ANTI-SEMITIC PAPERS--THE DEUTSCHE VOLKSBLATT--ACTED MORE DECENTLY.

WHAT GOT STILL MORE ON MY NERVES WAS THE REPUGNANT MANNER IN WHICH THE
BIG NEWSPAPERS CULTIVATED ADMIRATION FOR FRANCE. ONE REALLY HAD TO FEEL
ASHAMED OF BEING A GERMAN WHEN CONFRONTED BY THOSE MELLIFLUOUS HYMNS OF
PRAISE FOR 'THE GREAT CULTURE-NATION'. THIS WRETCHED GALLOMANIA MORE
OFTEN THAN ONCE MADE ME THROW AWAY ONE OF THOSE 'WORLD NEWSPAPERS'. I
NOW OFTEN TURNED TO THE VOLKSBLATT, WHICH WAS MUCH SMALLER IN SIZE BUT
WHICH TREATED SUCH SUBJECTS MORE DECENTLY. I WAS NOT IN ACCORD WITH ITS
SHARP ANTI-SEMITIC TONE; BUT AGAIN AND AGAIN I FOUND THAT ITS ARGUMENTS
GAVE ME GROUNDS FOR SERIOUS THOUGHT.

ANYHOW, IT WAS AS A RESULT OF SUCH READING THAT I CAME TO KNOW THE MAN
AND THE MOVEMENT WHICH THEN DETERMINED THE FATE OF VIENNA. THESE WERE
DR. KARL LUEGER AND THE CHRISTIAN SOCIALIST MOVEMENT. AT THE TIME I CAME
TO VIENNA I FELT OPPOSED TO BOTH. I LOOKED ON THE MAN AND THE MOVEMENT
AS 'REACTIONARY'.

BUT EVEN AN ELEMENTARY SENSE OF JUSTICE ENFORCED ME TO CHANGE MY OPINION
WHEN I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF KNOWING THE MAN AND HIS WORK, AND SLOWLY
THAT OPINION GREW INTO OUTSPOKEN ADMIRATION WHEN I HAD BETTER GROUNDS
FOR FORMING A JUDGMENT. TO-DAY, AS WELL AS THEN, I HOLD DR. KARL LUEGER
AS THE MOST EMINENT TYPE OF GERMAN BURGERMEISTER. HOW MANY PREJUDICES
WERE THROWN OVER THROUGH SUCH A CHANGE IN MY ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE
CHRISTIAN-SOCIALIST MOVEMENT!

MY IDEAS ABOUT ANTI-SEMITISM CHANGED ALSO IN THE COURSE OF TIME, BUT
THAT WAS THE CHANGE WHICH I FOUND MOST DIFFICULT. IT COST ME A GREATER
INTERNAL CONFLICT WITH MYSELF, AND IT WAS ONLY AFTER A STRUGGLE BETWEEN
REASON AND SENTIMENT THAT VICTORY BEGAN TO BE DECIDED IN FAVOUR OF THE
FORMER. TWO YEARS LATER SENTIMENT RALLIED TO THE SIDE OF REASONS AND
BECAME A FAITHFUL GUARDIAN AND COUNSELLOR.

AT THE TIME OF THIS BITTER STRUGGLE, BETWEEN CALM REASON AND THE
SENTIMENTS IN WHICH I HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP, THE LESSONS THAT I LEARNED ON
THE STREETS OF VIENNA RENDERED ME INVALUABLE ASSISTANCE. A TIME CAME
WHEN I NO LONGER PASSED BLINDLY ALONG THE STREET OF THE MIGHTY CITY, AS
I HAD DONE IN THE EARLY DAYS, BUT NOW WITH MY EYES OPEN NOT ONLY TO
STUDY THE BUILDINGS BUT ALSO THE HUMAN BEINGS.

ONCE, WHEN PASSING THROUGH THE INNER CITY, I SUDDENLY ENCOUNTERED A
PHENOMENON IN A LONG CAFTAN AND WEARING BLACK SIDE-LOCKS. MY FIRST
THOUGHT WAS: IS THIS A JEW? THEY CERTAINLY DID NOT HAVE THIS APPEARANCE
IN LINZ. I WATCHED THE MAN STEALTHILY AND CAUTIOUSLY; BUT THE LONGER I
GAZED AT THE STRANGE COUNTENANCE AND EXAMINED IT FEATURE BY FEATURE, THE
MORE THE QUESTION SHAPED ITSELF IN MY BRAIN: IS THIS A GERMAN?

AS WAS ALWAYS MY HABIT WITH SUCH EXPERIENCES, I TURNED TO BOOKS FOR HELP
IN REMOVING MY DOUBTS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I BOUGHT MYSELF
SOME ANTI-SEMITIC PAMPHLETS FOR A FEW PENCE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY ALL
BEGAN WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT IN PRINCIPLE THE READER HAD AT LEAST A
CERTAIN DEGREE OF INFORMATION ON THE JEWISH QUESTION OR WAS EVEN
FAMILIAR WITH IT. MOREOVER, THE TONE OF MOST OF THESE PAMPHLETS WAS SUCH
THAT I BECAME DOUBTFUL AGAIN, BECAUSE THE STATEMENTS MADE WERE PARTLY
SUPERFICIAL AND THE PROOFS EXTRAORDINARILY UNSCIENTIFIC. FOR WEEKS, AND
INDEED FOR MONTHS, I RETURNED TO MY OLD WAY OF THINKING. THE SUBJECT
APPEARED SO ENORMOUS AND THE ACCUSATIONS WERE SO FAR-REACHING THAT I WAS
AFRAID OF DEALING WITH IT UNJUSTLY AND SO I BECAME AGAIN ANXIOUS AND
UNCERTAIN.

NATURALLY I COULD NO LONGER DOUBT THAT HERE THERE WAS NOT A QUESTION OF
GERMANS WHO HAPPENED TO BE OF A DIFFERENT RELIGION BUT RATHER THAT THERE
WAS QUESTION OF AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PEOPLE. FOR AS SOON AS I BEGAN TO
INVESTIGATE THE MATTER AND OBSERVE THE JEWS, THEN VIENNA APPEARED TO ME
IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT. WHEREVER I NOW WENT I SAW JEWS, AND THE MORE I SAW
OF THEM THE MORE STRIKINGLY AND CLEARLY THEY STOOD OUT AS A DIFFERENT
PEOPLE FROM THE OTHER CITIZENS. ESPECIALLY THE INNER CITY AND THE
DISTRICT NORTHWARDS FROM THE DANUBE CANAL SWARMED WITH A PEOPLE WHO,
EVEN IN OUTER APPEARANCE, BORE NO SIMILARITY TO THE GERMANS.

BUT ANY INDECISION WHICH I MAY STILL HAVE FELT ABOUT THAT POINT WAS
FINALLY REMOVED BY THE ACTIVITIES OF A CERTAIN SECTION OF THE JEWS
THEMSELVES. A GREAT MOVEMENT, CALLED ZIONISM, AROSE AMONG THEM. ITS AIM
WAS TO ASSERT THE NATIONAL CHARACTER OF JUDAISM, AND THE MOVEMENT WAS
STRONGLY REPRESENTED IN VIENNA.

TO OUTWARD APPEARANCES IT SEEMED AS IF ONLY ONE GROUP OF JEWS CHAMPIONED
THIS MOVEMENT, WHILE THE GREAT MAJORITY DISAPPROVED OF IT, OR EVEN
REPUDIATED IT. BUT AN INVESTIGATION OF THE SITUATION SHOWED THAT THOSE
OUTWARD APPEARANCES WERE PURPOSELY MISLEADING. THESE OUTWARD APPEARANCES
EMERGED FROM A MIST OF THEORIES WHICH HAD BEEN PRODUCED FOR REASONS OF
EXPEDIENCY, IF NOT FOR PURPOSES OF DOWNRIGHT DECEPTION. FOR THAT PART OF
JEWRY WHICH WAS STYLED LIBERAL DID NOT DISOWN THE ZIONISTS AS IF THEY
WERE NOT MEMBERS OF THEIR RACE BUT RATHER AS BROTHER JEWS WHO PUBLICLY
PROFESSED THEIR FAITH IN AN UNPRACTICAL WAY, SO AS TO CREATE A DANGER
FOR JEWRY ITSELF.

THUS THERE WAS NO REAL RIFT IN THEIR INTERNAL SOLIDARITY.

THIS FICTITIOUS CONFLICT BETWEEN THE ZIONISTS AND THE LIBERAL JEWS SOON
DISGUSTED ME; FOR IT WAS FALSE THROUGH AND THROUGH AND IN DIRECT
CONTRADICTION TO THE MORAL DIGNITY AND IMMACULATE CHARACTER ON WHICH
THAT RACE HAD ALWAYS PRIDED ITSELF.

CLEANLINESS, WHETHER MORAL OR OF ANOTHER KIND, HAD ITS OWN PECULIAR
MEANING FOR THESE PEOPLE. THAT THEY WERE WATER-SHY WAS OBVIOUS ON
LOOKING AT THEM AND, UNFORTUNATELY, VERY OFTEN ALSO WHEN NOT LOOKING AT
THEM AT ALL. THE ODOUR OF THOSE PEOPLE IN CAFTANS OFTEN USED TO MAKE ME
FEEL ILL. BEYOND THAT THERE WERE THE UNKEMPT CLOTHES AND THE IGNOBLE
EXTERIOR.

ALL THESE DETAILS WERE CERTAINLY NOT ATTRACTIVE; BUT THE REVOLTING
FEATURE WAS THAT BENEATH THEIR UNCLEAN EXTERIOR ONE SUDDENLY PERCEIVED
THE MORAL MILDEW OF THE CHOSEN RACE.

WHAT SOON GAVE ME CAUSE FOR VERY SERIOUS CONSIDERATION WERE THE
ACTIVITIES OF THE JEWS IN CERTAIN BRANCHES OF LIFE, INTO THE MYSTERY OF
WHICH I PENETRATED LITTLE BY LITTLE. WAS THERE ANY SHADY UNDERTAKING,
ANY FORM OF FOULNESS, ESPECIALLY IN CULTURAL LIFE, IN WHICH AT LEAST ONE
JEW DID NOT PARTICIPATE? ON PUTTING THE PROBING KNIFE CAREFULLY TO THAT
KIND OF ABSCESS ONE IMMEDIATELY DISCOVERED, LIKE A MAGGOT IN A
PUTRESCENT BODY, A LITTLE JEW WHO WAS OFTEN BLINDED BY THE SUDDEN LIGHT.

IN MY EYES THE CHARGE AGAINST JUDAISM BECAME A GRAVE ONE THE MOMENT I
DISCOVERED THE JEWISH ACTIVITIES IN THE PRESS, IN ART, IN LITERATURE AND
THE THEATRE. ALL UNCTUOUS PROTESTS WERE NOW MORE OR LESS FUTILE. ONE
NEEDED ONLY TO LOOK AT THE POSTERS ANNOUNCING THE HIDEOUS PRODUCTIONS OF
THE CINEMA AND THEATRE, AND STUDY THE NAMES OF THE AUTHORS WHO WERE
HIGHLY LAUDED THERE IN ORDER TO BECOME PERMANENTLY ADAMANT ON JEWISH
QUESTIONS. HERE WAS A PESTILENCE, A MORAL PESTILENCE, WITH WHICH THE
PUBLIC WAS BEING INFECTED. IT WAS WORSE THAN THE BLACK PLAGUE OF LONG
AGO. AND IN WHAT MIGHTY DOSES THIS POISON WAS MANUFACTURED AND
DISTRIBUTED. NATURALLY, THE LOWER THE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL LEVEL OF
SUCH AN AUTHOR OF ARTISTIC PRODUCTS THE MORE INEXHAUSTIBLE HIS
FECUNDITY. SOMETIMES IT WENT SO FAR THAT ONE OF THESE FELLOWS, ACTING
LIKE A SEWAGE PUMP, WOULD SHOOT HIS FILTH DIRECTLY IN THE FACE OF OTHER
MEMBERS OF THE HUMAN RACE. IN THIS CONNECTION WE MUST REMEMBER THERE IS
NO LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF SUCH PEOPLE. ONE OUGHT TO REALIZE THAT FOR
ONE, GOETHE, NATURE MAY BRING INTO EXISTENCE TEN THOUSAND SUCH
DESPOILERS WHO ACT AS THE WORST KIND OF GERM-CARRIERS IN POISONING HUMAN
SOULS. IT WAS A TERRIBLE THOUGHT, AND YET IT COULD NOT BE AVOIDED, THAT
THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE JEWS SEEMED SPECIALLY DESTINED BY NATURE TO
PLAY THIS SHAMEFUL PART.

AND IS IT FOR THIS REASON THAT THEY CAN BE CALLED THE CHOSEN PEOPLE?

I BEGAN THEN TO INVESTIGATE CAREFULLY THE NAMES OF ALL THE FABRICATORS
OF THESE UNCLEAN PRODUCTS IN PUBLIC CULTURAL LIFE. THE RESULT OF THAT
INQUIRY WAS STILL MORE DISFAVOURABLE TO THE ATTITUDE WHICH I HAD
HITHERTO HELD IN REGARD TO THE JEWS. THOUGH MY FEELINGS MIGHT REBEL A
THOUSAND TIME, REASON NOW HAD TO DRAW ITS OWN CONCLUSIONS.

THE FACT THAT NINE-TENTHS OF ALL THE SMUTTY LITERATURE, ARTISTIC TRIPE
AND THEATRICAL BANALITIES, HAD TO BE CHARGED TO THE ACCOUNT OF PEOPLE
WHO FORMED SCARCELY ONE PER CENT. OF THE NATION--THAT FACT COULD NOT BE
GAINSAID. IT WAS THERE, AND HAD TO BE ADMITTED. THEN I BEGAN TO EXAMINE
MY FAVOURITE 'WORLD PRESS', WITH THAT FACT BEFORE MY MIND.

THE DEEPER MY SOUNDINGS WENT THE LESSER GREW MY RESPECT FOR THAT PRESS
WHICH I FORMERLY ADMIRED. ITS STYLE BECAME STILL MORE REPELLENT AND I
WAS FORCED TO REJECT ITS IDEAS AS ENTIRELY SHALLOW AND SUPERFICIAL. TO
CLAIM THAT IN THE PRESENTATION OF FACTS AND VIEWS ITS ATTITUDE WAS
IMPARTIAL SEEMED TO ME TO CONTAIN MORE FALSEHOOD THAN TRUTH. THE WRITERS
WERE--JEWS.

THOUSANDS OF DETAILS THAT I HAD SCARCELY NOTICED BEFORE SEEMED TO ME NOW
TO DESERVE ATTENTION. I BEGAN TO GRASP AND UNDERSTAND THINGS WHICH I HAD
FORMERLY LOOKED AT IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT.

I SAW THE LIBERAL POLICY OF THAT PRESS IN ANOTHER LIGHT. ITS DIGNIFIED
TONE IN REPLYING TO THE ATTACKS OF ITS ADVERSARIES AND ITS DEAD SILENCE
IN OTHER CASES NOW BECAME CLEAR TO ME AS PART OF A CUNNING AND
DESPICABLE WAY OF DECEIVING THE READERS. ITS BRILLIANT THEATRICAL
CRITICISMS ALWAYS PRAISED THE JEWISH AUTHORS AND ITS ADVERSE, CRITICISM
WAS RESERVED EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE GERMANS.

THE LIGHT PIN-PRICKS AGAINST WILLIAM II SHOWED THE PERSISTENCY OF ITS
POLICY, JUST AS DID ITS SYSTEMATIC COMMENDATION OF FRENCH CULTURE AND
CIVILIZATION. THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE FEUILLETONS WAS TRIVIAL AND
OFTEN PORNOGRAPHIC. THE LANGUAGE OF THIS PRESS AS A WHOLE HAD THE ACCENT
OF A FOREIGN PEOPLE. THE GENERAL TONE WAS OPENLY DEROGATORY TO THE
GERMANS AND THIS MUST HAVE BEEN DEFINITELY INTENTIONAL.

WHAT WERE THE INTERESTS THAT URGED THE VIENNA PRESS TO ADOPT SUCH A
POLICY? OR DID THEY DO SO MERELY BY CHANCE? IN ATTEMPTING TO FIND AN
ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS I GRADUALLY BECAME MORE AND MORE DUBIOUS.

THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED WHICH HELPED ME TO COME TO AN EARLY DECISION. I
BEGAN TO SEE THROUGH THE MEANING OF A WHOLE SERIES OF EVENTS THAT WERE
TAKING PLACE IN OTHER BRANCHES OF VIENNESE LIFE. ALL THESE WERE INSPIRED
BY A GENERAL CONCEPT OF MANNERS AND MORALS WHICH WAS OPENLY PUT INTO
PRACTICE BY A LARGE SECTION OF THE JEWS AND COULD BE ESTABLISHED AS
ATTRIBUTABLE TO THEM. HERE, AGAIN, THE LIFE WHICH I OBSERVED ON THE
STREETS TAUGHT ME WHAT EVIL REALLY IS.

THE PART WHICH THE JEWS PLAYED IN THE SOCIAL PHENOMENON OF PROSTITUTION,
AND MORE ESPECIALLY IN THE WHITE SLAVE TRAFFIC, COULD BE STUDIED HERE
BETTER THAN IN ANY OTHER WEST-EUROPEAN CITY, WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION
OF CERTAIN PORTS IN SOUTHERN FRANCE. WALKING BY NIGHT ALONG THE STREETS
OF THE LEOPOLDSTADT, ALMOST AT EVERY TURN WHETHER ONE WISHED IT OR NOT,
ONE WITNESSED CERTAIN HAPPENINGS OF WHOSE EXISTENCE THE GERMANS KNEW
NOTHING UNTIL THE WAR MADE IT POSSIBLE AND INDEED INEVITABLE FOR THE
SOLDIERS TO SEE SUCH THINGS ON THE EASTERN FRONT.

A COLD SHIVER RAN DOWN MY SPINE WHEN I FIRST ASCERTAINED THAT IT WAS THE
SAME KIND OF COLD-BLOODED, THICK-SKINNED AND SHAMELESS JEW WHO SHOWED
HIS CONSUMMATE SKILL IN CONDUCTING THAT REVOLTING EXPLOITATION OF THE
DREGS OF THE BIG CITY. THEN I BECAME FIRED WITH WRATH.

I HAD NOW NO MORE HESITATION ABOUT BRINGING THE JEWISH PROBLEM TO LIGHT
IN ALL ITS DETAILS. NO. HENCEFORTH I WAS DETERMINED TO DO SO. BUT AS I
LEARNED TO TRACK DOWN THE JEW IN ALL THE DIFFERENT SPHERES OF CULTURAL
AND ARTISTIC LIFE, AND IN THE VARIOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF THIS LIFE
EVERYWHERE, I SUDDENLY CAME UPON HIM IN A POSITION WHERE I HAD LEAST
EXPECTED TO FIND HIM. I NOW REALIZED THAT THE JEWS WERE THE LEADERS OF
SOCIAL DEMOCRACY. IN FACE OF THAT REVELATION THE SCALES FELL FROM MY
EYES. MY LONG INNER STRUGGLE WAS AT AN END.

IN MY RELATIONS WITH MY FELLOW WORKMEN I WAS OFTEN ASTONISHED TO FIND
HOW EASILY AND OFTEN THEY CHANGED THEIR OPINIONS ON THE SAME QUESTIONS,
SOMETIMES WITHIN A FEW DAYS AND SOMETIMES EVEN WITHIN THE COURSE OF A
FEW HOURS. I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW MEN WHO ALWAYS HAD
REASONABLE IDEAS WHEN THEY SPOKE AS INDIVIDUALS WITH ONE ANOTHER
SUDDENLY LOST THIS REASONABLENESS THE MOMENT THEY ACTED IN THE MASS.
THAT PHENOMENON OFTEN TEMPTED ONE ALMOST TO DESPAIR. I USED TO DISPUTE
WITH THEM FOR HOURS AND WHEN I SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING THEM TO WHAT I
CONSIDERED A REASONABLE WAY OF THINKING I REJOICED AT MY SUCCESS. BUT
NEXT DAY I WOULD FIND THAT IT HAD BEEN ALL IN VAIN. IT WAS SADDENING TO
THINK I HAD TO BEGIN IT ALL OVER AGAIN. LIKE A PENDULUM IN ITS ETERNAL
SWAY, THEY WOULD FALL BACK INTO THEIR ABSURD OPINIONS.

I WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR POSITION FULLY. THEY WERE DISSATISFIED
WITH THEIR LOT AND CURSED THE FATE WHICH HAD HIT THEM SO HARD. THEY
HATED THEIR EMPLOYERS, WHOM THEY LOOKED UPON AS THE HEARTLESS
ADMINISTRATORS OF THEIR CRUEL DESTINY. OFTEN THEY USED ABUSIVE LANGUAGE
AGAINST THE PUBLIC OFFICIALS, WHOM THEY ACCUSED OF HAVING NO SYMPATHY
WITH THE SITUATION OF THE WORKING PEOPLE. THEY MADE PUBLIC PROTESTS
AGAINST THE COST OF LIVING AND PARADED THROUGH THE STREETS IN DEFENCE OF
THEIR CLAIMS. AT LEAST ALL THIS COULD BE EXPLAINED ON REASONABLE
GROUNDS. BUT WHAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND WAS THE BOUNDLESS HATRED
THEY EXPRESSED AGAINST THEIR OWN FELLOW CITIZENS, HOW THEY DISPARAGED
THEIR OWN NATION, MOCKED AT ITS GREATNESS, REVILED ITS HISTORY AND
DRAGGED THE NAMES OF ITS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS MEN IN THE GUTTER.

THIS HOSTILITY TOWARDS THEIR OWN KITH AND KIN, THEIR OWN NATIVE LAND AND
HOME WAS AS IRRATIONAL AS IT WAS INCOMPREHENSIBLE. IT WAS AGAINST
NATURE.

ONE COULD CURE THAT MALADY TEMPORARILY, BUT ONLY FOR SOME DAYS OR AT
LEAST SOME WEEKS. BUT ON MEETING THOSE WHOM ONE BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN
CONVERTED ONE FOUND THAT THEY HAD BECOME AS THEY WERE BEFORE. THAT
MALADY AGAINST NATURE HELD THEM ONCE AGAIN IN ITS CLUTCHES.

I GRADUALLY DISCOVERED THAT THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PRESS WAS
PREDOMINANTLY CONTROLLED BY JEWS. BUT I DID NOT ATTACH SPECIAL
IMPORTANCE TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, FOR THE SAME STATE OF AFFAIRS EXISTED
ALSO IN OTHER NEWSPAPERS. BUT THERE WAS ONE STRIKING FACT IN THIS
CONNECTION. IT WAS THAT THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE NEWSPAPER WITH WHICH JEWS
WERE CONNECTED THAT COULD BE SPOKEN OF AS NATIONAL, IN THE MEANING THAT
MY EDUCATION AND CONVICTIONS ATTACHED TO THAT WORD.

MAKING AN EFFORT TO OVERCOME MY NATURAL RELUCTANCE, I TRIED TO READ
ARTICLES OF THIS NATURE PUBLISHED IN THE MARXIST PRESS; BUT IN DOING SO
MY AVERSION INCREASED ALL THE MORE. AND THEN I SET ABOUT LEARNING
SOMETHING OF THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE AND PUBLISHED THIS MISCHIEVOUS STUFF.
FROM THE PUBLISHER DOWNWARDS, ALL OF THEM WERE JEWS. I RECALLED TO MIND
THE NAMES OF THE PUBLIC LEADERS OF MARXISM, AND THEN I REALIZED THAT
MOST OF THEM BELONGED TO THE CHOSEN RACE--THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC
REPRESENTATIVES IN THE IMPERIAL CABINET AS WELL AS THE SECRETARIES OF
THE TRADES UNIONS AND THE STREET AGITATORS. EVERYWHERE THE SAME SINISTER
PICTURE PRESENTED ITSELF. I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE ROW OF
NAMES--AUSTERLITZ, DAVID, ADLER, ELLENBOGEN, AND OTHERS. ONE FACT BECAME
QUITE EVIDENT TO ME. IT WAS THAT THIS ALIEN RACE HELD IN ITS HANDS THE
LEADERSHIP OF THAT SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY WITH WHOSE MINOR
REPRESENTATIVES I HAD BEEN DISPUTING FOR MONTHS PAST. I WAS HAPPY AT
LAST TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT THE JEW IS NOT A GERMAN.

THUS I FINALLY DISCOVERED WHO WERE THE EVIL SPIRITS LEADING OUR PEOPLE
ASTRAY. THE SOJOURN IN VIENNA FOR ONE YEAR HAD PROVED LONG ENOUGH TO
CONVINCE ME THAT NO WORKER IS SO ROOTED IN HIS PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS THAT
HE WILL NOT SURRENDER THEM IN FACE OF BETTER AND CLEARER ARGUMENTS AND
EXPLANATIONS. GRADUALLY I BECAME AN EXPERT IN THE DOCTRINE OF THE
MARXISTS AND USED THIS KNOWLEDGE AS AN INSTRUMENT TO DRIVE HOME MY OWN
FIRM CONVICTIONS. I WAS SUCCESSFUL IN NEARLY EVERY CASE. THE GREAT
MASSES CAN BE RESCUED, BUT A LOT OF TIME AND A LARGE SHARE OF HUMAN
PATIENCE MUST BE DEVOTED TO SUCH WORK.

BUT A JEW CAN NEVER BE RESCUED FROM HIS FIXED NOTIONS.

IT WAS THEN SIMPLE ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT TO SHOW THEM THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR
TEACHING. WITHIN MY SMALL CIRCLE I TALKED TO THEM UNTIL MY THROAT ACHED
AND MY VOICE GREW HOARSE. I BELIEVED THAT I COULD FINALLY CONVINCE THEM
OF THE DANGER INHERENT IN THE MARXIST FOLLIES. BUT I ONLY ACHIEVED THE
CONTRARY RESULT. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IMMEDIATELY THE DISASTROUS EFFECTS
OF THE MARXIST THEORY AND ITS APPLICATION IN PRACTICE BECAME EVIDENT,
THE STRONGER BECAME THEIR OBSTINACY.

THE MORE I DEBATED WITH THEM THE MORE FAMILIAR I BECAME WITH THEIR
ARGUMENTATIVE TACTICS. AT THE OUTSET THEY COUNTED UPON THE STUPIDITY OF
THEIR OPPONENTS, BUT WHEN THEY GOT SO ENTANGLED THAT THEY COULD NOT FIND
A WAY OUT THEY PLAYED THE TRICK OF ACTING AS INNOCENT SIMPLETONS. SHOULD
THEY FAIL, IN SPITE OF THEIR TRICKS OF LOGIC, THEY ACTED AS IF THEY
COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE COUNTER ARGUMENTS AND BOLTED AWAY TO ANOTHER
FIELD OF DISCUSSION. THEY WOULD LAY DOWN TRUISMS AND PLATITUDES; AND, IF
YOU ACCEPTED THESE, THEN THEY WERE APPLIED TO OTHER PROBLEMS AND MATTERS
OF AN ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT NATURE FROM THE ORIGINAL THEME. IF YOU FACED
THEM WITH THIS POINT THEY WOULD ESCAPE AGAIN, AND YOU COULD NOT BRING
THEM TO MAKE ANY PRECISE STATEMENT. WHENEVER ONE TRIED TO GET A FIRM
GRIP ON ANY OF THESE APOSTLES ONE'S HAND GRASPED ONLY JELLY AND SLIME
WHICH SLIPPED THROUGH THE FINGERS AND COMBINED AGAIN INTO A SOLID MASS A
MOMENT AFTERWARDS. IF YOUR ADVERSARY FELT FORCED TO GIVE IN TO YOUR
ARGUMENT, ON ACCOUNT OF THE OBSERVERS PRESENT, AND IF YOU THEN THOUGHT
THAT AT LAST YOU HAD GAINED GROUND, A SURPRISE WAS IN STORE FOR YOU ON
THE FOLLOWING DAY. THE JEW WOULD BE UTTERLY OBLIVIOUS TO WHAT HAD
HAPPENED THE DAY BEFORE, AND HE WOULD START ONCE AGAIN BY REPEATING HIS
FORMER ABSURDITIES, AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. SHOULD YOU BECOME
INDIGNANT AND REMIND HIM OF YESTERDAY'S DEFEAT, HE PRETENDED
ASTONISHMENT AND COULD NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING, EXCEPT THAT ON THE
PREVIOUS DAY HE HAD PROVED THAT HIS STATEMENTS WERE CORRECT. SOMETIMES I
WAS DUMBFOUNDED. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT AMAZED ME THE MORE--THE ABUNDANCE OF
THEIR VERBIAGE OR THE ARTFUL WAY IN WHICH THEY DRESSED UP THEIR
FALSEHOODS. I GRADUALLY CAME TO HATE THEM.

YET ALL THIS HAD ITS GOOD SIDE; BECAUSE THE MORE I CAME TO KNOW THE
INDIVIDUAL LEADERS, OR AT LEAST THE PROPAGANDISTS, OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY,
MY LOVE FOR MY OWN PEOPLE INCREASED CORRESPONDINGLY. CONSIDERING THE
SATANIC SKILL WHICH THESE EVIL COUNSELLORS DISPLAYED, HOW COULD THEIR
UNFORTUNATE VICTIMS BE BLAMED? INDEED, I FOUND IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT
MYSELF TO BE A MATCH FOR THE DIALECTICAL PERFIDY OF THAT RACE. HOW
FUTILE IT WAS TO TRY TO WIN OVER SUCH PEOPLE WITH ARGUMENT, SEEING THAT
THEIR VERY MOUTHS DISTORTED THE TRUTH, DISOWNING THE VERY WORDS THEY HAD
JUST USED AND ADOPTING THEM AGAIN A FEW MOMENTS AFTERWARDS TO SERVE
THEIR OWN ENDS IN THE ARGUMENT! NO. THE MORE I CAME TO KNOW THE JEW, THE
EASIER IT WAS TO EXCUSE THE WORKERS.

IN MY OPINION THE MOST CULPABLE WERE NOT TO BE FOUND AMONG THE WORKERS
BUT RATHER AMONG THOSE WHO DID NOT THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO TAKE THE
TROUBLE TO SYMPATHIZE WITH THEIR OWN KINSFOLK AND GIVE TO THE
HARD-WORKING SON OF THE NATIONAL FAMILY WHAT WAS HIS BY THE IRON LOGIC
OF JUSTICE, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PLACING HIS SEDUCER AND CORRUPTER
AGAINST THE WALL.

URGED BY MY OWN DAILY EXPERIENCES, I NOW BEGAN TO INVESTIGATE MORE
THOROUGHLY THE SOURCES OF THE MARXIST TEACHING ITSELF. ITS EFFECTS WERE
WELL KNOWN TO ME IN DETAIL. AS A RESULT OF CAREFUL OBSERVATION, ITS
DAILY PROGRESS HAD BECOME OBVIOUS TO ME. AND ONE NEEDED ONLY A LITTLE
IMAGINATION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FORECAST THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH MUST
RESULT FROM IT. THE ONLY QUESTION NOW WAS: DID THE FOUNDERS FORESEE THE
EFFECTS OF THEIR WORK IN THE FORM WHICH THOSE EFFECTS HAVE SHOWN
THEMSELVES TO-DAY, OR WERE THE FOUNDERS THEMSELVES THE VICTIMS OF AN
ERROR? TO MY MIND BOTH ALTERNATIVES WERE POSSIBLE.

IF THE SECOND QUESTION MUST BE ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THEN IT WAS
THE DUTY OF EVERY THINKING PERSON TO OPPOSE THIS SINISTER MOVEMENT WITH
A VIEW TO PREVENTING IT FROM PRODUCING ITS WORST RESULTS. BUT IF THE
FIRST QUESTION MUST BE ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THEN IT MUST BE
ADMITTED THAT THE ORIGINAL AUTHORS OF THIS EVIL WHICH HAS INFECTED THE
NATIONS WERE DEVILS INCARNATE. FOR ONLY IN THE BRAIN OF A MONSTER, AND
NOT THAT OF A MAN, COULD THE PLAN OF THIS ORGANIZATION TAKE SHAPE WHOSE
WORKINGS MUST FINALLY BRING ABOUT THE COLLAPSE OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION AND
TURN THIS WORLD INTO A DESERT WASTE.

SUCH BEING THE CASE THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE LEFT WAS TO FIGHT, AND IN THAT
FIGHT TO EMPLOY ALL THE WEAPONS WHICH THE HUMAN SPIRIT AND INTELLECT AND
WILL COULD FURNISH LEAVING IT TO FATE TO DECIDE IN WHOSE FAVOUR THE
BALANCE SHOULD FALL.

AND SO I BEGAN TO GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE AUTHORS OF THIS TEACHING,
WITH A VIEW TO STUDYING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE MOVEMENT. THE FACT THAT I
ATTAINED MY OBJECT SOONER THAN I COULD HAVE ANTICIPATED WAS DUE TO THE
DEEPER INSIGHT INTO THE JEWISH QUESTION WHICH I THEN GAINED, MY
KNOWLEDGE OF THIS QUESTION BEING HITHERTO RATHER SUPERFICIAL. THIS NEWLY
ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE ALONE ENABLED ME TO MAKE A PRACTICAL COMPARISON
BETWEEN THE REAL CONTENT AND THE THEORETICAL PRETENTIOUSNESS OF THE
TEACHING LAID DOWN BY THE APOSTOLIC FOUNDERS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY;
BECAUSE I NOW UNDERSTOOD THE LANGUAGE OF THE JEW. I REALIZED THAT THE
JEW USES LANGUAGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISSIMULATING HIS THOUGHT OR AT
LEAST VEILING IT, SO THAT HIS REAL AIM CANNOT BE DISCOVERED BY WHAT HE
SAYS BUT RATHER BY READING BETWEEN THE LINES. THIS KNOWLEDGE WAS THE
OCCASION OF THE GREATEST INNER REVOLUTION THAT I HAD YET EXPERIENCED.
FROM BEING A SOFT-HEARTED COSMOPOLITAN I BECAME AN OUT-AND-OUT
ANTI-SEMITE.

ONLY ON ONE FURTHER OCCASION, AND THAT FOR THE LAST TIME, DID I GIVE WAY
TO OPPRESSING THOUGHTS WHICH CAUSED ME SOME MOMENTS OF PROFOUND ANXIETY.

AS I CRITICALLY REVIEWED THE ACTIVITIES OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE THROUGHOUT
LONG PERIODS OF HISTORY I BECAME ANXIOUS AND ASKED MYSELF WHETHER FOR
SOME INSCRUTABLE REASONS BEYOND THE COMPREHENSION OF POOR MORTALS SUCH
AS OURSELVES, DESTINY MAY NOT HAVE IRREVOCABLY DECREED THAT THE FINAL
VICTORY MUST GO TO THIS SMALL NATION? MAY IT NOT BE THAT THIS PEOPLE
WHICH HAS LIVED ONLY FOR THE EARTH HAS BEEN PROMISED THE EARTH AS A
RECOMPENSE? IS OUR RIGHT TO STRUGGLE FOR OUR OWN SELF-PRESERVATION BASED
ON REALITY, OR IS IT A MERELY SUBJECTIVE THING? FATE ANSWERED THE
QUESTION FOR ME INASMUCH AS IT LED ME TO MAKE A DETACHED AND EXHAUSTIVE
INQUIRY INTO THE MARXIST TEACHING AND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE JEWISH
PEOPLE IN CONNECTION WITH IT.

THE JEWISH DOCTRINE OF MARXISM REPUDIATES THE ARISTOCRATIC PRINCIPLE OF
NATURE AND SUBSTITUTES FOR IT THE ETERNAL PRIVILEGE OF FORCE AND ENERGY,
NUMERICAL MASS AND ITS DEAD WEIGHT. THUS IT DENIES THE INDIVIDUAL WORTH
OF THE HUMAN PERSONALITY, IMPUGNS THE TEACHING THAT NATIONHOOD AND RACE
HAVE A PRIMARY SIGNIFICANCE, AND BY DOING THIS IT TAKES AWAY THE VERY
FOUNDATIONS OF HUMAN EXISTENCE AND HUMAN CIVILIZATION. IF THE MARXIST
TEACHING WERE TO BE ACCEPTED AS THE FOUNDATION OF THE LIFE OF THE
UNIVERSE, IT WOULD LEAD TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ALL ORDER THAT IS
CONCEIVABLE TO THE HUMAN MIND. AND THUS THE ADOPTION OF SUCH A LAW WOULD
PROVOKE CHAOS IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE GREATEST ORGANISM THAT WE KNOW,
WITH THE RESULT THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THIS EARTHLY PLANET WOULD
FINALLY DISAPPEAR.

SHOULD THE JEW, WITH THE AID OF HIS MARXIST CREED, TRIUMPH OVER THE
PEOPLE OF THIS WORLD, HIS CROWN WILL BE THE FUNERAL WREATH OF MANKIND,
AND THIS PLANET WILL ONCE AGAIN FOLLOW ITS ORBIT THROUGH ETHER, WITHOUT
ANY HUMAN LIFE ON ITS SURFACE, AS IT DID MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO.

AND SO I BELIEVE TO-DAY THAT MY CONDUCT IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WILL
OF THE ALMIGHTY CREATOR. IN STANDING GUARD AGAINST THE JEW I AM
DEFENDING THE HANDIWORK OF THE LORD.




CHAPTER III



POLITICAL REFLECTIONS ARISING OUT OF MY SOJOURN IN VIENNA


GENERALLY SPEAKING A MAN SHOULD NOT PUBLICLY TAKE PART IN POLITICS
BEFORE HE HAS REACHED THE AGE OF THIRTY, THOUGH, OF COURSE, EXCEPTIONS
MUST BE MADE IN THE CASE OF THOSE WHO ARE NATURALLY GIFTED WITH
EXTRAORDINARY POLITICAL ABILITIES. THAT AT LEAST IS MY OPINION TO-DAY.
AND THE REASON FOR IT IS THAT UNTIL HE REACHES HIS THIRTIETH YEAR OR
THEREABOUTS A MAN'S MENTAL DEVELOPMENT WILL MOSTLY CONSIST IN ACQUIRING
AND SIFTING SUCH KNOWLEDGE AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE GROUNDWORK OF A
GENERAL PLATFORM FROM WHICH HE CAN EXAMINE THE DIFFERENT POLITICAL
PROBLEMS THAT ARISE FROM DAY TO DAY AND BE ABLE TO ADOPT A DEFINITE
ATTITUDE TOWARDS EACH. A MAN MUST FIRST ACQUIRE A FUND OF GENERAL IDEAS
AND FIT THEM TOGETHER SO AS TO FORM AN ORGANIC STRUCTURE OF PERSONAL
THOUGHT OR OUTLOOK ON LIFE--A WELTANSCHAUUNG. THEN HE WILL HAVE THAT
MENTAL EQUIPMENT WITHOUT WHICH HE CANNOT FORM HIS OWN JUDGMENTS ON
PARTICULAR QUESTIONS OF THE DAY, AND HE WILL HAVE ACQUIRED THOSE
QUALITIES THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR CONSISTENCY AND STEADFASTNESS IN THE
FORMATION OF POLITICAL OPINIONS. SUCH A MAN IS NOW QUALIFIED, AT LEAST
SUBJECTIVELY, TO TAKE HIS PART IN THE POLITICAL CONDUCT OF PUBLIC
AFFAIRS.

IF THESE PRE-REQUISITE CONDITIONS ARE NOT FULFILLED, AND IF A MAN SHOULD
ENTER POLITICAL LIFE WITHOUT THIS EQUIPMENT, HE WILL RUN A TWOFOLD RISK.
IN THE FIRST PLACE, HE MAY FIND DURING THE COURSE OF EVENTS THAT THE
STAND WHICH HE ORIGINALLY TOOK IN REGARD TO SOME ESSENTIAL QUESTION WAS
WRONG. HE WILL NOW HAVE TO ABANDON HIS FORMER POSITION OR ELSE STICK TO
IT AGAINST HIS BETTER KNOWLEDGE AND RIPER WISDOM AND AFTER HIS REASON
AND CONVICTIONS HAVE ALREADY PROVED IT UNTENABLE. IF HE ADOPT THE FORMER
LINE OF ACTION HE WILL FIND HIMSELF IN A DIFFICULT PERSONAL SITUATION;
BECAUSE IN GIVING UP A POSITION HITHERTO MAINTAINED HE WILL APPEAR
INCONSISTENT AND WILL HAVE NO RIGHT TO EXPECT HIS FOLLOWERS TO REMAIN AS
LOYAL TO HIS LEADERSHIP AS THEY WERE BEFORE. AND, AS REGARDS THE
FOLLOWERS THEMSELVES, THEY MAY EASILY LOOK UPON THEIR LEADER'S CHANGE OF
POLICY AS SHOWING A LACK OF JUDGMENT INHERENT IN HIS CHARACTER.
MOREOVER, THE CHANGE MUST CAUSE IN THEM A CERTAIN FEELING OF
DISCOMFITURE VIS-Ã€-VIS THOSE WHOM THE LEADER FORMERLY OPPOSED.

IF HE ADOPTS THE SECOND ALTERNATIVE--WHICH SO VERY FREQUENTLY HAPPENS
TO-DAY--THEN PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS OF THE LEADER HAVE NO LONGER HIS
PERSONAL PERSUASION TO SUPPORT THEM. AND THE MORE THAT IS THE CASE THE
DEFENCE OF HIS CAUSE WILL BE ALL THE MORE HOLLOW AND SUPERFICIAL. HE NOW
DESCENDS TO THE ADOPTION OF VULGAR MEANS IN HIS DEFENCE. WHILE HE
HIMSELF NO LONGER DREAMS SERIOUSLY OF STANDING BY HIS POLITICAL
PROTESTATIONS TO THE LAST--FOR NO MAN WILL DIE IN DEFENCE OF SOMETHING
IN WHICH HE DOES NOT BELIEVE--HE MAKES INCREASING DEMANDS ON HIS
FOLLOWERS. INDEED, THE GREATER BE THE MEASURE OF HIS OWN INSINCERITY,
THE MORE UNFORTUNATE AND INCONSIDERATE BECOME HIS CLAIMS ON HIS PARTY
ADHERENTS. FINALLY, HE THROWS ASIDE THE LAST VESTIGES OF TRUE LEADERSHIP
AND BEGINS TO PLAY POLITICS. THIS MEANS THAT HE BECOMES ONE OF THOSE
WHOSE ONLY CONSISTENCY IS THEIR INCONSISTENCY, ASSOCIATED WITH
OVERBEARING INSOLENCE AND OFTENTIMES AN ARTFUL MENDACITY DEVELOPED TO A
SHAMELESSLY HIGH DEGREE.

SHOULD SUCH A PERSON, TO THE MISFORTUNE OF ALL DECENT PEOPLE, SUCCEED IN
BECOMING A PARLIAMENTARY DEPUTY IT WILL BE CLEAR FROM THE OUTSET THAT
FOR HIM THE ESSENCE OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY CONSISTS IN A HEROIC STRUGGLE
TO KEEP PERMANENT HOLD ON THIS MILK-BOTTLE AS A SOURCE OF LIVELIHOOD FOR
HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY. THE MORE HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN ARE DEPENDENT ON
HIM, THE MORE STUBBORNLY WILL HE FIGHT TO MAINTAIN FOR HIMSELF THE
REPRESENTATION OF HIS PARLIAMENTARY CONSTITUENCY. FOR THAT REASON ANY
OTHER PERSON WHO GIVES EVIDENCE OF POLITICAL CAPACITY IS HIS PERSONAL
ENEMY. IN EVERY NEW MOVEMENT HE WILL APPREHEND THE POSSIBLE BEGINNING OF
HIS OWN DOWNFALL. AND EVERYONE WHO IS A BETTER MAN THAN HIMSELF WILL
APPEAR TO HIM IN THE LIGHT OF A MENACE.

I SHALL SUBSEQUENTLY DEAL MORE FULLY WITH THE PROBLEM TO WHICH THIS KIND
OF PARLIAMENTARY VERMIN GIVE RISE.

WHEN A MAN HAS REACHED HIS THIRTIETH YEAR HE HAS STILL A GREAT DEAL TO
LEARN. THAT IS OBVIOUS. BUT HENCEFORWARD WHAT HE LEARNS WILL PRINCIPALLY
BE AN AMPLIFICATION OF HIS BASIC IDEAS; IT WILL BE FITTED IN WITH THEM
ORGANICALLY SO AS TO FILL UP THE FRAMEWORK OF THE FUNDAMENTAL
WELTANSCHAUUNG WHICH HE ALREADY POSSESSES. WHAT HE LEARNS ANEW WILL NOT
IMPLY THE ABANDONMENT OF PRINCIPLES ALREADY HELD, BUT RATHER A DEEPER
KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE PRINCIPLES. AND THUS HIS COLLEAGUES WILL NEVER HAVE
THE DISCOMFORTING FEELING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN HITHERTO FALSELY LED BY
HIM. ON THE CONTRARY, THEIR CONFIDENCE IS INCREASED WHEN THEY PERCEIVE
THAT THEIR LEADER'S QUALITIES ARE STEADILY DEVELOPING ALONG THE LINES OF
AN ORGANIC GROWTH WHICH RESULTS FROM THE CONSTANT ASSIMILATION OF NEW
IDEAS; SO THAT THE FOLLOWERS LOOK UPON THIS PROCESS AS SIGNIFYING AN
ENRICHMENT OF THE DOCTRINES IN WHICH THEY THEMSELVES BELIEVE, IN THEIR
EYES EVERY SUCH DEVELOPMENT IS A NEW WITNESS TO THE CORRECTNESS OF THAT
WHOLE BODY OF OPINION WHICH HAS HITHERTO BEEN HELD.

A LEADER WHO HAS TO ABANDON THE PLATFORM FOUNDED ON HIS GENERAL
PRINCIPLES, BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZES THE FOUNDATION AS FALSE, CAN ACT WITH
HONOUR ONLY WHEN HE DECLARES HIS READINESS TO ACCEPT THE FINAL
CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ERRONEOUS VIEWS. IN SUCH A CASE HE OUGHT TO REFRAIN
FROM TAKING PUBLIC PART IN ANY FURTHER POLITICAL ACTIVITY. HAVING ONCE
GONE ASTRAY ON ESSENTIAL THINGS HE MAY POSSIBLY GO ASTRAY A SECOND TIME.
BUT, ANYHOW, HE HAS NO RIGHT WHATSOEVER TO EXPECT OR DEMAND THAT HIS
FELLOW CITIZENS SHOULD CONTINUE TO GIVE HIM THEIR SUPPORT.

HOW LITTLE SUCH A LINE OF CONDUCT COMMENDS ITSELF TO OUR PUBLIC LEADERS
NOWADAYS IS PROVED BY THE GENERAL CORRUPTION PREVALENT AMONG THE CABAL
WHICH AT THE PRESENT MOMENT FEELS ITSELF CALLED TO POLITICAL LEADERSHIP.
IN THE WHOLE CABAL THERE IS SCARCELY ONE WHO IS PROPERLY EQUIPPED FOR
THIS TASK.

ALTHOUGH IN THOSE DAYS I USED TO GIVE MORE TIME THAN MOST OTHERS TO THE
CONSIDERATION OF POLITICAL QUESTION, YET I CAREFULLY REFRAINED FROM
TAKING AN OPEN PART IN POLITICS. ONLY TO A SMALL CIRCLE DID I SPEAK OF
THOSE THINGS WHICH AGITATED MY MIND OR WERE THE CAUSE OF CONSTANT
PREOCCUPATION FOR ME. THE HABIT OF DISCUSSING MATTERS WITHIN SUCH A
RESTRICTED GROUP HAD MANY ADVANTAGES IN ITSELF. RATHER THAN TALK AT
THEM, I LEARNED TO FEEL MY WAY INTO THE MODES OF THOUGHT AND VIEWS OF
THOSE MEN AROUND ME. OFTENTIMES SUCH WAYS OF THINKING AND SUCH VIEWS
WERE QUITE PRIMITIVE. THUS I TOOK EVERY POSSIBLE OCCASION TO INCREASE MY
KNOWLEDGE OF MEN.

NOWHERE AMONG THE GERMAN PEOPLE WAS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MAKING SUCH A
STUDY SO FAVOURABLE AS IN VIENNA.

IN THE OLD DANUBIAN MONARCHY POLITICAL THOUGHT WAS WIDER IN ITS RANGE
AND HAD A RICHER VARIETY OF INTERESTS THAN IN THE GERMANY OF THAT
EPOCH--EXCEPTING CERTAIN PARTS OF PRUSSIA, HAMBURG AND THE DISTRICTS
BORDERING ON THE NORTH SEA. WHEN I SPEAK OF AUSTRIA HERE I MEAN THAT
PART OF THE GREAT HABSBURG EMPIRE WHICH, BY REASON OF ITS GERMAN
POPULATION, FURNISHED NOT ONLY THE HISTORIC BASIS FOR THE FORMATION OF
THIS STATE BUT WHOSE POPULATION WAS FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES ALSO THE
EXCLUSIVE SOURCE OF CULTURAL LIFE IN THAT POLITICAL SYSTEM WHOSE
STRUCTURE WAS SO ARTIFICIAL. AS TIME WENT ON THE STABILITY OF THE
AUSTRIAN STATE AND THE GUARANTEE OF ITS CONTINUED EXISTENCE DEPENDED
MORE AND MORE ON THE MAINTENANCE OF THIS GERM-CELL OF THAT HABSBURG
EMPIRE.

THE HEREDITARY IMPERIAL PROVINCES CONSTITUTED THE HEART OF THE EMPIRE.
AND IT WAS THIS HEART THAT CONSTANTLY SENT THE BLOOD OF LIFE PULSATING
THROUGH THE WHOLE POLITICAL AND CULTURAL SYSTEM. CORRESPONDING TO THE
HEART OF THE EMPIRE, VIENNA SIGNIFIED THE BRAIN AND THE WILL. AT THAT
TIME VIENNA PRESENTED AN APPEARANCE WHICH MADE ONE THINK OF HER AS AN
ENTHRONED QUEEN WHOSE AUTHORITATIVE SWAY UNITED THE CONGLOMERATION OF
HETEROGENOUS NATIONALITIES THAT LIVED UNDER THE HABSBURG SCEPTRE. THE
RADIANT BEAUTY OF THE CAPITAL CITY MADE ONE FORGET THE SAD SYMPTOMS OF
SENILE DECAY WHICH THE STATE MANIFESTED AS A WHOLE.

THOUGH THE EMPIRE WAS INTERNALLY RICKETY BECAUSE OF THE TERRIFIC
CONFLICT GOING ON BETWEEN THE VARIOUS NATIONALITIES, THE OUTSIDE
WORLD--AND GERMANY IN PARTICULAR--SAW ONLY THAT LOVELY PICTURE OF THE
CITY. THE ILLUSION WAS ALL THE GREATER BECAUSE AT THAT TIME VIENNA
SEEMED TO HAVE RISEN TO ITS HIGHEST PITCH OF SPLENDOUR. UNDER A MAYOR,
WHO HAD THE TRUE STAMP OF ADMINISTRATIVE GENIUS, THE VENERABLE
RESIDENTIAL CITY OF THE EMPERORS OF THE OLD EMPIRE SEEMED TO HAVE THE
GLORY OF ITS YOUTH RENEWED. THE LAST GREAT GERMAN WHO SPRANG FROM THE
RANKS OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAD COLONIZED THE EAST MARK WAS NOT A
'STATESMAN', IN THE OFFICIAL SENSE. THIS DR. LUEGAR, HOWEVER, IN HIS
RÃ´LE AS MAYOR OF 'THE IMPERIAL CAPITAL AND RESIDENTIAL CITY', HAD
ACHIEVED SO MUCH IN ALMOST ALL SPHERES OF MUNICIPAL ACTIVITY, WHETHER
ECONOMIC OR CULTURAL, THAT THE HEART OF THE WHOLE EMPIRE THROBBED WITH
RENEWED VIGOUR. HE THUS PROVED HIMSELF A MUCH GREATER STATESMAN THAN THE
SO-CALLED 'DIPLOMATS' OF THAT PERIOD.

THE FACT THAT THIS POLITICAL SYSTEM OF HETEROGENEOUS RACES CALLED
AUSTRIA, FINALLY BROKE DOWN IS NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER OF POLITICAL
INCAPACITY ON THE PART OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT IN THE OLD EAST MARK. THE
COLLAPSE WAS THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION. TEN
MILLION PEOPLE CANNOT PERMANENTLY HOLD TOGETHER A STATE OF FIFTY
MILLIONS, COMPOSED OF DIFFERENT AND CONVICTING NATIONALITIES, UNLESS
CERTAIN DEFINITE PRE-REQUISITE CONDITIONS ARE AT HAND WHILE THERE IS
STILL TIME TO AVAIL OF THEM.

THE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN HAD VERY BIG WAYS OF THINKING. ACCUSTOMED TO LIVE IN
A GREAT EMPIRE, HE HAD A KEEN SENSE OF THE OBLIGATIONS INCUMBENT ON HIM
IN SUCH A SITUATION. HE WAS THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE AUSTRIAN STATE WHO
LOOKED BEYOND THE BORDERS OF THE NARROW LANDS BELONGING TO THE CROWN AND
TOOK IN ALL THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE IN THE SWEEP OF HIS MIND. INDEED
WHEN DESTINY SEVERED HIM FROM THE COMMON FATHERLAND HE TRIED TO MASTER
THE TREMENDOUS TASK WHICH WAS SET BEFORE HIM AS A CONSEQUENCE. THIS TASK
WAS TO MAINTAIN FOR THE GERMAN-AUSTRIANS THAT PATRIMONY WHICH, THROUGH
INNUMERABLE STRUGGLES, THEIR ANCESTORS HAD ORIGINALLY WRESTED FROM THE
EAST. IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE GERMAN-AUSTRIANS COULD NOT PUT
THEIR UNDIVIDED STRENGTH INTO THIS EFFORT, BECAUSE THE HEARTS AND MINDS
OF THE BEST AMONG THEM WERE CONSTANTLY TURNING BACK TOWARDS THEIR
KINSFOLK IN THE MOTHERLAND, SO THAT ONLY A FRACTION OF THEIR ENERGY
REMAINED TO BE EMPLOYED AT HOME.

THE MENTAL HORIZON OF THE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN WAS COMPARATIVELY BROAD. HIS
COMMERCIAL INTERESTS COMPRISED ALMOST EVERY SECTION OF THE HETEROGENEOUS
EMPIRE. THE CONDUCT OF ALMOST ALL IMPORTANT UNDERTAKINGS WAS IN HIS
HANDS. HE PROVIDED THE STATE, FOR THE MOST PART, WITH ITS LEADING
TECHNICAL EXPERTS AND CIVIL SERVANTS. HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR CARRYING ON
THE FOREIGN TRADE OF THE COUNTRY, AS FAR AS THAT SPHERE OF ACTIVITY WAS
NOT UNDER JEWISH CONTROL, THE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN EXCLUSIVELY REPRESENTED
THE POLITICAL CEMENT THAT HELD THE STATE TOGETHER. HIS MILITARY DUTIES
CARRIED HIM FAR BEYOND THE NARROW FRONTIERS OF HIS HOMELAND. THOUGH THE
RECRUIT MIGHT JOIN A REGIMENT MADE UP OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT, THE
REGIMENT ITSELF MIGHT BE STATIONED IN HERZEGOVINA AS WELL AS IN VIENNA
OR GALICIA. THE OFFICERS IN THE HABSBURG ARMIES WERE STILL GERMANS AND
SO WAS THE PREDOMINATING ELEMENT IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF THE CIVIL
SERVICE. ART AND SCIENCE WERE IN GERMAN HANDS. APART FROM THE NEW
ARTISTIC TRASH, WHICH MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY A NEGRO TRIBE,
ALL GENUINE ARTISTIC INSPIRATION CAME FROM THE GERMAN SECTION OF THE
POPULATION. IN MUSIC, ARCHITECTURE, SCULPTURE AND PAINTING, VIENNA
ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED THE ENTIRE DUAL MONARCHY. AND THE SOURCE NEVER
SEEMED TO SHOW SIGNS OF A POSSIBLE EXHAUSTION. FINALLY, IT WAS THE
GERMAN ELEMENT THAT DETERMINED THE CONDUCT OF FOREIGN POLICY, THOUGH A
SMALL NUMBER OF HUNGARIANS WERE ALSO ACTIVE IN THAT FIELD.

ALL EFFORTS, HOWEVER, TO SAVE THE UNITY OF THE STATE WERE DOOMED TO END
IN FAILURE, BECAUSE THE ESSENTIAL PRE-REQUISITES WERE MISSING.

THERE WAS ONLY ONE POSSIBLE WAY TO CONTROL AND HOLD IN CHECK THE
CENTRIFUGAL FORCES OF THE DIFFERENT AND DIFFERING NATIONALITIES. THIS
WAY WAS: TO GOVERN THE AUSTRIAN STATE AND ORGANIZE IT INTERNALLY ON THE
PRINCIPLE OF CENTRALIZATION. IN NO OTHER WAY IMAGINABLE COULD THE
EXISTENCE OF THAT STATE BE ASSURED.

NOW AND AGAIN THERE WERE LUCID INTERVALS IN THE HIGHER RULING QUARTERS
WHEN THIS TRUTH WAS RECOGNIZED. BUT IT WAS SOON FORGOTTEN AGAIN, OR ELSE
DELIBERATELY IGNORED, BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES TO BE OVERCOME IN
PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE. EVERY PROJECT WHICH AIMED AT GIVING THE EMPIRE
A MORE FEDERAL SHAPE WAS BOUND TO BE INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO
STRONG CENTRAL AUTHORITY WHICH COULD EXERCISE SUFFICIENT POWER WITHIN
THE STATE TO HOLD THE FEDERAL ELEMENTS TOGETHER. IT MUST BE REMEMBERED
IN THIS CONNECTION THAT CONDITIONS IN AUSTRIA WERE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM
THOSE WHICH CHARACTERIZED THE GERMAN STATE AS FOUNDED BY BISMARCK.
GERMANY WAS FACED WITH ONLY ONE DIFFICULTY, WHICH WAS THAT OF
TRANSFORMING THE PURELY POLITICAL TRADITIONS, BECAUSE THROUGHOUT THE
WHOLE OF BISMARCK'S GERMANY THERE WAS A COMMON CULTURAL BASIS. THE
GERMAN EMPIRE CONTAINED ONLY MEMBERS OF ONE AND THE SAME RACIAL OR
NATIONAL STOCK, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW MINOR FOREIGN FRAGMENTS.

DEMOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS IN AUSTRIA WERE QUITE THE REVERSE. WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF HUNGARY THERE WAS NO POLITICAL TRADITION, COMING DOWN FROM
A GREAT PAST, IN ANY OF THE VARIOUS AFFILIATED COUNTRIES. IF THERE HAD
BEEN, TIME HAD EITHER WIPED OUT ALL TRACES OF IT, OR AT LEAST, RENDERED
THEM OBSCURE. MOREOVER, THIS WAS THE EPOCH WHEN THE PRINCIPLE OF
NATIONALITY BEGAN TO BE IN ASCENDANT; AND THAT PHENOMENON AWAKENED THE
NATIONAL INSTINCTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES AFFILIATED UNDER THE
HABSBURG SCEPTRE. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THE ACTION OF THESE NEWLY
AWAKENED NATIONAL FORCES; BECAUSE, ADJACENT TO THE FRONTIERS OF THE DUAL
MONARCHY, NEW NATIONAL STATES WERE SPRINGING UP WHOSE PEOPLE WERE OF THE
SAME OR KINDRED RACIAL STOCK AS THE RESPECTIVE NATIONALITIES THAT
CONSTITUTED THE HABSBURG EMPIRE. THESE NEW STATES WERE ABLE TO EXERCISE
A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN THE GERMAN ELEMENT.

EVEN VIENNA COULD NOT HOLD OUT FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD IN THIS CONFLICT.
WHEN BUDAPEST HAD DEVELOPED INTO A METROPOLIS A RIVAL HAD GROWN UP WHOSE
MISSION WAS, NOT TO HELP IN HOLDING TOGETHER THE VARIOUS DIVERGENT PARTS
OF THE EMPIRE, BUT RATHER TO STRENGTHEN ONE PART. WITHIN A SHORT TIME
PRAGUE FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE OF BUDAPEST; AND LATER ON CAME LEMBERG,
LAIBACH AND OTHERS. BY RAISING THESE PLACES WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN
PROVINCIAL TOWNS TO THE RANK OF NATIONAL CITIES, RALLYING CENTRES WERE
PROVIDED FOR AN INDEPENDENT CULTURAL LIFE. THROUGH THIS THE LOCAL
NATIONAL INSTINCTS ACQUIRED A SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION AND THEREWITH GAINED
A MORE PROFOUND HOLD ON THE PEOPLE. THE TIME WAS BOUND TO COME WHEN THE
PARTICULARIST INTERESTS OF THOSE VARIOUS COUNTRIES WOULD BECOME STRONGER
THAN THEIR COMMON IMPERIAL INTERESTS. ONCE THAT STAGE HAD BEEN REACHED,
AUSTRIA'S DOOM WAS SEALED.

THE COURSE OF THIS DEVELOPMENT WAS CLEARLY PERCEPTIBLE SINCE THE DEATH
OF JOSEPH II. ITS RAPIDITY DEPENDED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, SOME OF
WHICH HAD THEIR SOURCE IN THE MONARCHY ITSELF; WHILE OTHERS RESULTED
FROM THE POSITION WHICH THE EMPIRE HAD TAKEN IN FOREIGN POLITICS.

IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE ANYTHING LIKE A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT FOR THE
PERMANENT CONSOLIDATION OF THE AUSTRIAN STATE UNLESS A FIRM AND
PERSISTENT POLICY OF CENTRALIZATION WERE PUT INTO FORCE. BEFORE
EVERYTHING ELSE THE PRINCIPLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADOPTED THAT ONLY ONE
COMMON LANGUAGE COULD BE USED AS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF THE STATE.
THUS IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO EMPHASIZE THE FORMAL UNITY OF THAT IMPERIAL
COMMONWEALTH. AND THUS THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD HAVE IN ITS HANDS A
TECHNICAL INSTRUMENT WITHOUT WHICH THE STATE COULD NOT ENDURE AS A
POLITICAL UNITY. IN THE SAME WAY THE SCHOOL AND OTHER FORMS OF EDUCATION
SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO INCULCATE A FEELING OF COMMON CITIZENSHIP. SUCH
AN OBJECTIVE COULD NOT BE REACHED WITHIN TEN OR TWENTY YEARS. THE EFFORT
WOULD HAVE TO BE ENVISAGED IN TERMS OF CENTURIES; JUST AS IN ALL
PROBLEMS OF COLONIZATION, STEADY PERSEVERANCE IS A FAR MORE IMPORTANT
ELEMENT THAN THE OUTPUT OF ENERGETIC EFFORT AT THE MOMENT.

IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE COUNTRY MUST BE
GOVERNED AND ADMINISTERED BY STRICTLY ADHERING TO THE PRINCIPLE OF
UNIFORMITY.

FOR ME IT WAS QUITE INSTRUCTIVE TO DISCOVER WHY THIS DID NOT TAKE PLACE,
OR RATHER WHY IT WAS NOT DONE. THOSE WHO WERE GUILTY OF THE OMISSION
MUST BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BREAK-UP OF THE HABSBURG EMPIRE.

MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE, THE EXISTENCE OF THE OLD AUSTRIA DEPENDED ON
A STRONG AND CAPABLE GOVERNMENT. THE HABSBURG EMPIRE LACKED ETHNICAL
UNIFORMITY, WHICH CONSTITUTES THE FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF A NATIONAL STATE
AND WILL PRESERVE THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A STATE EVEN THOUGH THE RULING
POWER SHOULD BE GROSSLY INEFFICIENT. WHEN A STATE IS COMPOSED OF A
HOMOGENEOUS POPULATION, THE NATURAL INERTIA OF SUCH A POPULATION WILL
HOLD THE STAGE TOGETHER AND MAINTAIN ITS EXISTENCE THROUGH ASTONISHINGLY
LONG PERIODS OF MISGOVERNMENT AND MALADMINISTRATION. IT MAY OFTEN SEEM
AS IF THE PRINCIPLE OF LIFE HAD DIED OUT IN SUCH A BODY-POLITIC; BUT A
TIME COMES WHEN THE APPARENT CORPSE RISES UP AND DISPLAYS BEFORE THE
WORLD AN ASTONISHING MANIFESTATION OF ITS INDESTRUCTIBLE VITALITY.

BUT THE SITUATION IS UTTERLY DIFFERENT IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE POPULATION
IS NOT HOMOGENEOUS, WHERE THERE IS NO BOND OF COMMON BLOOD BUT ONLY THAT
OF ONE RULING HAND. SHOULD THE RULING HAND SHOW SIGNS OF WEAKNESS IN
SUCH A STATE THE RESULT WILL NOT BE TO CAUSE A KIND OF HIBERNATION OF
THE STATE BUT RATHER TO AWAKEN THE INDIVIDUALIST INSTINCTS WHICH ARE
SLUMBERING IN THE ETHNOLOGICAL GROUPS. THESE INSTINCTS DO NOT MAKE
THEMSELVES FELT AS LONG AS THESE GROUPS ARE DOMINATED BY A STRONG
CENTRAL WILL-TO-GOVERN. THE DANGER WHICH EXISTS IN THESE SLUMBERING
SEPARATIST INSTINCTS CAN BE RENDERED MORE OR LESS INNOCUOUS ONLY THROUGH
CENTURIES OF COMMON EDUCATION, COMMON TRADITIONS AND COMMON INTERESTS.
THE YOUNGER SUCH STATES ARE, THE MORE THEIR EXISTENCE WILL DEPEND ON THE
ABILITY AND STRENGTH OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. IF THEIR FOUNDATION WAS
DUE ONLY TO THE WORK OF A STRONG PERSONALITY OR A LEADER WHO IS A MAN OF
GENIUS, IN MANY CASES THEY WILL BREAK UP AS SOON AS THE FOUNDER
DISAPPEARS; BECAUSE, THOUGH GREAT, HE STOOD ALONE. BUT EVEN AFTER
CENTURIES OF A COMMON EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCES THESE SEPARATIST
INSTINCTS I HAVE SPOKEN OF ARE NOT ALWAYS COMPLETELY OVERCOME. THEY MAY
BE ONLY DORMANT AND MAY SUDDENLY AWAKEN WHEN THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
SHOWS WEAKNESS AND THE FORCE OF A COMMON EDUCATION AS WELL AS THE
PRESTIGE OF A COMMON TRADITION PROVE UNABLE TO WITHSTAND THE VITAL
ENERGIES OF SEPARATIST NATIONALITIES FORGING AHEAD TOWARDS THE SHAPING
OF THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL EXISTENCE.

THE FAILURE TO SEE THE TRUTH OF ALL THIS CONSTITUTED WHAT MAY BE CALLED
THE TRAGIC CRIME OF THE HABSBURG RULERS.

ONLY BEFORE THE EYES OF ONE HABSBURG RULER, AND THAT FOR THE LAST TIME,
DID THE HAND OF DESTINY HOLD ALOFT THE TORCH THAT THREW LIGHT ON THE
FUTURE OF HIS COUNTRY. BUT THE TORCH WAS THEN EXTINGUISHED FOR EVER.

JOSEPH II, ROMAN EMPEROR OF THE GERMAN NATION, WAS FILLED WITH A GROWING
ANXIETY WHEN HE REALIZED THE FACT THAT HIS HOUSE WAS REMOVED TO AN
OUTLYING FRONTIER OF HIS EMPIRE AND THAT THE TIME WOULD SOON BE AT HAND
WHEN IT WOULD BE OVERTURNED AND ENGULFED IN THE WHIRLPOOL CAUSED BY THAT
BABYLON OF NATIONALITIES, UNLESS SOMETHING WAS DONE AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR
TO OVERCOME THE DIRE CONSEQUENCES RESULTING FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OF HIS
ANCESTORS. WITH SUPERHUMAN ENERGY THIS 'FRIEND OF MANKIND' MADE EVERY
POSSIBLE EFFORT TO COUNTERACT THE EFFECTS OF THE CARELESSNESS AND
THOUGHTLESSNESS OF HIS PREDECESSORS. WITHIN ONE DECADE HE STROVE TO
REPAIR THE DAMAGE THAT HAD BEEN DONE THROUGH CENTURIES. IF DESTINY HAD
ONLY GRANTED HIM FORTY YEARS FOR HIS LABOURS, AND IF ONLY TWO
GENERATIONS HAD CARRIED ON THE WORK WHICH HE HAD STARTED, THE MIRACLE
MIGHT HAVE BEEN PERFORMED. BUT WHEN HE DIED, BROKEN IN BODY AND SPIRIT
AFTER TEN YEARS OF RULERSHIP, HIS WORK SANK WITH HIM INTO THE GRAVE AND
RESTS WITH HIM THERE IN THE CAPUCIN CRYPT, SLEEPING ITS ETERNAL SLEEP,
HAVING NEVER AGAIN SHOWED SIGNS OF AWAKENING.

HIS SUCCESSORS HAD NEITHER THE ABILITY NOR THE WILL-POWER NECESSARY FOR
THE TASK THEY HAD TO FACE.

WHEN THE FIRST SIGNS OF A NEW REVOLUTIONARY EPOCH APPEARED IN EUROPE
THEY GRADUALLY SCATTERED THE FIRE THROUGHOUT AUSTRIA. AND WHEN THE FIRE
BEGAN TO GLOW STEADILY IT WAS FED AND FANNED NOT BY THE SOCIAL OR
POLITICAL CONDITIONS BUT BY FORCES THAT HAD THEIR ORIGIN IN THE
NATIONALIST YEARNINGS OF THE VARIOUS ETHNIC GROUPS.

THE EUROPEAN REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT OF 1848 PRIMARILY TOOK THE FORM OF A
CLASS CONFLICT IN ALMOST EVERY OTHER COUNTRY, BUT IN AUSTRIA IT TOOK THE
FORM OF A NEW RACIAL STRUGGLE. IN SO FAR AS THE GERMAN-AUSTRIANS THERE
FORGOT THE ORIGINS OF THE MOVEMENT, OR PERHAPS HAD FAILED TO RECOGNIZE
THEM AT THE START AND CONSEQUENTLY TOOK PART IN THE REVOLUTIONARY
UPRISING, THEY SEALED THEIR OWN FATE. FOR THEY THUS HELPED TO AWAKEN THE
SPIRIT OF WESTERN DEMOCRACY WHICH, WITHIN A SHORT WHILE, SHATTERED THE
FOUNDATIONS OF THEIR OWN EXISTENCE.

THE SETTING UP OF A REPRESENTATIVE PARLIAMENTARY BODY, WITHOUT INSISTING
ON THE PRELIMINARY THAT ONLY ONE LANGUAGE SHOULD BE USED IN ALL PUBLIC
INTERCOURSE UNDER THE STATE, WAS THE FIRST GREAT BLOW TO THE
PREDOMINANCE OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT IN THE DUAL MONARCHY. FROM THAT
MOMENT THE STATE WAS ALSO DOOMED TO COLLAPSE SOONER OR LATER. ALL THAT
FOLLOWED WAS NOTHING BUT THE HISTORICAL LIQUIDATION OF AN EMPIRE.

TO WATCH THAT PROCESS OF PROGRESSIVE DISINTEGRATION WAS A TRAGIC AND AT
THE SAME TIME AN INSTRUCTIVE EXPERIENCE. THE EXECUTION OF HISTORY'S
DECREE WAS CARRIED OUT IN THOUSANDS OF DETAILS. THE FACT THAT GREAT
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WENT ABOUT BLINDFOLDED AMID THE MANIFEST SIGNS OF
DISSOLUTION ONLY PROVES THAT THE GODS HAD DECREED THE DESTRUCTION OF
AUSTRIA.

I DO NOT WISH TO DWELL ON DETAILS BECAUSE THAT WOULD LIE OUTSIDE THE
SCOPE OF THIS BOOK. I WANT TO TREAT IN DETAIL ONLY THOSE EVENTS WHICH
ARE TYPICAL AMONG THE CAUSES THAT LEAD TO THE DECLINE OF NATIONS AND
STATES AND WHICH ARE THEREFORE OF IMPORTANCE TO OUR PRESENT AGE.
MOREOVER, THE STUDY OF THESE EVENTS HELPED TO FURNISH THE BASIS OF MY
OWN POLITICAL OUTLOOK.

AMONG THE INSTITUTIONS WHICH MOST CLEARLY MANIFESTED UNMISTAKABLE SIGNS
OF DECAY, EVEN TO THE WEAK-SIGHTED PHILISTINE, WAS THAT WHICH, OF ALL
THE INSTITUTIONS OF STATE, OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE MOST FIRMLY FOUNDED--I
MEAN THE PARLIAMENT, OR THE REICHSRAT (IMPERIAL COUNCIL) AS IT WAS
CALLED IN AUSTRIA.

THE PATTERN FOR THIS CORPORATE BODY WAS OBVIOUSLY THAT WHICH EXISTED IN
ENGLAND, THE LAND OF CLASSIC DEMOCRACY. THE WHOLE OF THAT EXCELLENT
ORGANIZATION WAS BODILY TRANSFERRED TO AUSTRIA WITH AS LITTLE ALTERATION
AS POSSIBLE.

AS THE AUSTRIAN COUNTERPART TO THE BRITISH TWO-CHAMBER SYSTEM A CHAMBER
OF DEPUTIES AND A HOUSE OF LORDS (HERRENHAUS) WERE ESTABLISHED IN
VIENNA. THE HOUSES THEMSELVES, CONSIDERED AS BUILDINGS WERE SOMEWHAT
DIFFERENT. WHEN BARRY BUILT HIS PALACES, OR, AS WE SAY THE HOUSES OF
PARLIAMENT, ON THE SHORE OF THE THAMES, HE COULD LOOK TO THE HISTORY OF
THE BRITISH EMPIRE FOR THE INSPIRATION OF HIS WORK. IN THAT HISTORY HE
FOUND SUFFICIENT MATERIAL TO FILL AND DECORATE THE 1,200 NICHES,
BRACKETS, AND PILLARS OF HIS MAGNIFICENT EDIFICE. HIS STATUES AND
PAINTINGS MADE THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TEMPLES
DEDICATED TO THE GLORY OF THE NATION.

THERE IT WAS THAT VIENNA ENCOUNTERED THE FIRST DIFFICULTY. WHEN HANSEN,
THE DANISH ARCHITECT, HAD COMPLETED THE LAST GABLE OF THE MARBLE PALACE
IN WHICH THE NEW BODY OF POPULAR REPRESENTATIVES WAS TO BE HOUSED HE HAD
TO TURN TO THE ANCIENT CLASSICAL WORLD FOR SUBJECTS TO FILL OUT HIS
DECORATIVE PLAN. THIS THEATRICAL SHRINE OF 'WESTERN DEMOCRACY' WAS
ADORNED WITH THE STATUES AND PORTRAITS OF GREEK AND ROMAN STATESMEN AND
PHILOSOPHERS. AS IF IT WERE MEANT FOR A SYMBOL OF IRONY, THE HORSES OF
THE QUADRIGA THAT SURMOUNTS THE TWO HOUSES ARE PULLING APART FROM ONE
ANOTHER TOWARDS ALL FOUR QUARTERS OF THE GLOBE. THERE COULD BE NO BETTER
SYMBOL FOR THE KIND OF ACTIVITY GOING ON WITHIN THE WALLS OF THAT SAME
BUILDING.

THE 'NATIONALITIES' WERE OPPOSED TO ANY KIND OF GLORIFICATION OF
AUSTRIAN HISTORY IN THE DECORATION OF THIS BUILDING, INSISTING THAT SUCH
WOULD CONSTITUTE AN OFFENCE TO THEM AND A PROVOCATION. MUCH THE SAME
HAPPENED IN GERMANY, WHERE THE REICH-STAG, BUILT BY WALLOT, WAS NOT
DEDICATED TO THE GERMAN PEOPLE UNTIL THE CANNONS WERE THUNDERING IN THE
WORLD WAR. AND THEN IT WAS DEDICATED BY AN INSCRIPTION.

I WAS NOT YET TWENTY YEARS OF AGE WHEN I FIRST ENTERED THE PALACE ON THE
FRANZENS-RING TO WATCH AND LISTEN IN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES. THAT FIRST
EXPERIENCE AROUSED IN ME A PROFOUND FEELING OF REPUGNANCE.

I HAD ALWAYS HATED THE PARLIAMENT, BUT NOT AS AN INSTITUTION IN ITSELF.
QUITE THE CONTRARY. AS ONE WHO CHERISHED IDEALS OF POLITICAL FREEDOM I
COULD NOT EVEN IMAGINE ANY OTHER FORM OF GOVERNMENT. IN THE LIGHT OF MY
ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG I SHOULD THEN HAVE CONSIDERED IT
A CRIME AGAINST LIBERTY AND REASON TO THINK OF ANY KIND OF DICTATORSHIP
AS A POSSIBLE FORM OF GOVERNMENT.

A CERTAIN ADMIRATION WHICH I HAD FOR THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT CONTRIBUTED
TOWARDS THE FORMATION OF THIS OPINION. I BECAME IMBUED WITH THAT FEELING
OF ADMIRATION ALMOST WITHOUT MY BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE EFFECT OF IT
THROUGH SO MUCH READING OF NEWSPAPERS WHILE I WAS YET QUITE YOUNG. I
COULD NOT DISCARD THAT ADMIRATION ALL IN A MOMENT. THE DIGNIFIED WAY IN
WHICH THE BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS FULFILLED ITS FUNCTION IMPRESSED ME
GREATLY, THANKS LARGELY TO THE GLOWING TERMS IN WHICH THE AUSTRIAN PRESS
REPORTED THESE EVENTS. I USED TO ASK MYSELF WHETHER THERE COULD BE ANY
NOBLER FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAN SELF-GOVERNMENT BY THE PEOPLE.

BUT THESE CONSIDERATIONS FURNISHED THE VERY MOTIVES OF MY HOSTILITY TO
THE AUSTRIAN PARLIAMENT. THE FORM IN WHICH PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT WAS
HERE REPRESENTED SEEMED UNWORTHY OF ITS GREAT PROTOTYPE. THE FOLLOWING
CONSIDERATIONS ALSO INFLUENCED MY ATTITUDE:

THE FATE OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT IN THE AUSTRIAN STATE DEPENDED ON ITS
POSITION IN PARLIAMENT. UP TO THE TIME THAT UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE BY SECRET
BALLOT WAS INTRODUCED THE GERMAN REPRESENTATIVES HAD A MAJORITY IN THE
PARLIAMENT, THOUGH THAT MAJORITY WAS NOT A VERY SUBSTANTIAL ONE. THIS
SITUATION GAVE CAUSE FOR ANXIETY BECAUSE THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC FRACTION
OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT COULD NOT BE RELIED UPON WHEN NATIONAL QUESTIONS
WERE AT STAKE. IN MATTERS THAT WERE OF CRITICAL CONCERN FOR THE GERMAN
ELEMENT, THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS ALWAYS TOOK UP AN ANTI-GERMAN STAND
BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF LOSING THEIR FOLLOWERS AMONG THE OTHER
NATIONAL GROUPS. ALREADY AT THAT TIME--BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF
UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE--THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC PARTY COULD NO LONGER BE
CONSIDERED AS A GERMAN PARTY. THE INTRODUCTION OF UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE PUT
AN END EVEN TO THE PURELY NUMERICAL PREDOMINANCE OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT.
THE WAY WAS NOW CLEAR FOR THE FURTHER 'DE-GERMANIZATION' OF THE AUSTRIAN
STATE.

THE NATIONAL INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO
WELCOME A REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM IN WHICH THE GERMAN ELEMENT WAS NOT
REALLY REPRESENTED AS SUCH, BUT ALWAYS BETRAYED BY THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC
FRACTION. YET ALL THESE, AND MANY OTHERS, WERE DEFECTS WHICH COULD NOT
BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM AS SUCH, BUT RATHER TO THE
AUSTRIAN STATE IN PARTICULAR. I STILL BELIEVED THAT IF THE GERMAN
MAJORITY COULD BE RESTORED IN THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY THERE WOULD BE NO
OCCASION TO OPPOSE SUCH A SYSTEM AS LONG AS THE OLD AUSTRIAN STATE
CONTINUED TO EXIST.

SUCH WAS MY GENERAL ATTITUDE AT THE TIME WHEN I FIRST ENTERED THOSE
SACRED AND CONTENTIOUS HALLS. FOR ME THEY WERE SACRED ONLY BECAUSE OF
THE RADIANT BEAUTY OF THAT MAJESTIC EDIFICE. A GREEK WONDER ON GERMAN
SOIL.

BUT I SOON BECAME ENRAGED BY THE HIDEOUS SPECTACLE THAT MET MY EYES.
SEVERAL HUNDRED REPRESENTATIVES WERE THERE TO DISCUSS A PROBLEM OF GREAT
ECONOMICAL IMPORTANCE AND EACH REPRESENTATIVE HAD THE RIGHT TO HAVE HIS
SAY.

THAT EXPERIENCE OF A DAY WAS ENOUGH TO SUPPLY ME WITH FOOD FOR THOUGHT
DURING SEVERAL WEEKS AFTERWARDS.

THE INTELLECTUAL LEVEL OF THE DEBATE WAS QUITE LOW. SOME TIMES THE
DEBATERS DID NOT MAKE THEMSELVES INTELLIGIBLE AT ALL. SEVERAL OF THOSE
PRESENT DID NOT SPEAK GERMAN BUT ONLY THEIR SLAV VERNACULARS OR
DIALECTS. THUS I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HEARING WITH MY OWN EARS WHAT I
HAD BEEN HITHERTO ACQUAINTED WITH ONLY THROUGH READING THE NEWSPAPERS. A
TURBULENT MASS OF PEOPLE, ALL GESTICULATING AND BAWLING AGAINST ONE
ANOTHER, WITH A PATHETIC OLD MAN SHAKING HIS BELL AND MAKING FRANTIC
EFFORTS TO CALL THE HOUSE TO A SENSE OF ITS DIGNITY BY FRIENDLY APPEALS,
EXHORTATIONS, AND GRAVE WARNINGS.

I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM LAUGHING.

SEVERAL WEEKS LATER I PAID A SECOND VISIT. THIS TIME THE HOUSE PRESENTED
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PICTURE, SO MUCH SO THAT ONE COULD HARDLY
RECOGNIZE IT AS THE SAME PLACE. THE HALL WAS PRACTICALLY EMPTY. THEY
WERE SLEEPING IN THE OTHER ROOMS BELOW. ONLY A FEW DEPUTIES WERE IN
THEIR PLACES, YAWNING IN EACH OTHER'S FACES. ONE WAS SPEECHIFYING. A
DEPUTY SPEAKER WAS IN THE CHAIR. WHEN HE LOOKED ROUND IT WAS QUITE PLAIN
THAT HE FELT BORED.

THEN I BEGAN TO REFLECT SERIOUSLY ON THE WHOLE THING. I WENT TO THE
PARLIAMENT WHENEVER I HAD ANY TIME TO SPARE AND WATCHED THE SPECTACLE
SILENTLY BUT ATTENTIVELY. I LISTENED TO THE DEBATES, AS FAR AS THEY
COULD BE UNDERSTOOD, AND I STUDIED THE MORE OR LESS INTELLIGENT FEATURES
OF THOSE 'ELECT' REPRESENTATIVES OF THE VARIOUS NATIONALITIES WHICH
COMPOSED THAT MOTLEY STATE. GRADUALLY I FORMED MY OWN IDEAS ABOUT WHAT I
SAW.

A YEAR OF SUCH QUIET OBSERVATION WAS SUFFICIENT TO TRANSFORM OR
COMPLETELY DESTROY MY FORMER CONVICTIONS AS TO THE CHARACTER OF THIS
PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTION. I NO LONGER OPPOSED MERELY THE PERVERTED FORM
WHICH THE PRINCIPLE OF PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION HAD ASSUMED IN
AUSTRIA. NO. IT HAD BECOME IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO ACCEPT THE SYSTEM IN
ITSELF. UP TO THAT TIME I HAD BELIEVED THAT THE DISASTROUS DEFICIENCIES
OF THE AUSTRIAN PARLIAMENT WERE DUE TO THE LACK OF A GERMAN MAJORITY,
BUT NOW I RECOGNIZED THAT THE INSTITUTION ITSELF WAS WRONG IN ITS VERY
ESSENCE AND FORM.

A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS PRESENTED THEMSELVES BEFORE MY MIND. I STUDIED MORE
CLOSELY THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE OF 'DECISION BY THE MAJORITY VOTE', AND
I SCRUTINIZED NO LESS CAREFULLY THE INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL WORTH OF THE
GENTLEMEN WHO, AS THE CHOSEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION, WERE
ENTRUSTED WITH THE TASK OF MAKING THIS INSTITUTION FUNCTION.

THUS IT HAPPENED THAT AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME I CAME TO KNOW THE
INSTITUTION ITSELF AND THOSE OF WHOM IT WAS COMPOSED. AND IT WAS THUS
THAT, WITHIN THE COURSE OF A FEW YEARS, I CAME TO FORM A CLEAR AND VIVID
PICTURE OF THE AVERAGE TYPE OF THAT MOST LIGHTLY WORSHIPPED PHENOMENON
OF OUR TIME--THE PARLIAMENTARY DEPUTY. THE PICTURE OF HIM WHICH I THEN
FORMED BECAME DEEPLY ENGRAVED ON MY MIND AND I HAVE NEVER ALTERED IT
SINCE, AT LEAST AS FAR AS ESSENTIALS GO.

ONCE AGAIN THESE OBJECT-LESSONS TAKEN FROM REAL LIFE SAVED ME FROM
GETTING FIRMLY ENTANGLED BY A THEORY WHICH AT FIRST SIGHT SEEMS SO
ALLURING TO MANY PEOPLE, THOUGH THAT THEORY ITSELF IS A SYMPTOM OF HUMAN
DECADENCE.

DEMOCRACY, AS PRACTISED IN WESTERN EUROPE TO-DAY, IS THE FORE-RUNNER OF
MARXISM. IN FACT, THE LATTER WOULD NOT BE CONCEIVABLE WITHOUT THE
FORMER. DEMOCRACY IS THE BREEDING-GROUND IN WHICH THE BACILLI OF THE
MARXIST WORLD PEST CAN GROW AND SPREAD. BY THE INTRODUCTION OF
PARLIAMENTARIANISM, DEMOCRACY PRODUCED AN ABORTION OF FILTH AND FIRE
(NOTE 6), THE CREATIVE FIRE OF WHICH, HOWEVER, SEEMS TO HAVE DIED OUT.

[NOTE 6. SPOTTGEBURT VON DRECK UND FEUER. THIS IS THE EPITHET THAT FAUST
HURLS AT MEPHISTOPHELES AS THE LATTER INTRUDES ON THE CONVERSATION
BETWEEN FAUST AND MARTHA IN THE GARDEN:

MEPHISTOPHELES: THOU, FULL OF SENSUAL, SUPER-SENSUAL DESIRE,
                A GIRL BY THE NOSE IS LEADING THEE.
FAUST: ABORTION, THOU OF FILTH AND FIRE.]

I AM MORE THAN GRATEFUL TO FATE THAT THIS PROBLEM CAME TO MY NOTICE WHEN
I WAS STILL IN VIENNA; FOR IF I HAD BEEN IN GERMANY AT THAT TIME I MIGHT
EASILY HAVE FOUND ONLY A SUPERFICIAL SOLUTION. IF I HAD BEEN IN BERLIN
WHEN I FIRST DISCOVERED WHAT AN ILLOGICAL THING THIS INSTITUTION IS
WHICH WE CALL PARLIAMENT, I MIGHT EASILY HAVE GONE TO THE OTHER EXTREME
AND BELIEVED--AS MANY PEOPLE BELIEVED, AND APPARENTLY NOT WITHOUT GOOD
REASON--THAT THE SALVATION OF THE PEOPLE AND THE EMPIRE COULD BE SECURED
ONLY BY RESTRENGTHENING THE PRINCIPLE OF IMPERIAL AUTHORITY. THOSE WHO
HAD THIS BELIEF DID NOT DISCERN THE TENDENCIES OF THEIR TIME AND WERE
BLIND TO THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE PEOPLE.

IN AUSTRIA ONE COULD NOT BE SO EASILY MISLED. THERE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO
FALL FROM ONE ERROR INTO ANOTHER. IF THE PARLIAMENT WERE WORTHLESS, THE
HABSBURGS WERE WORSE; OR AT LEAST NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE BETTER.
THE PROBLEM WAS NOT SOLVED BY REJECTING THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM.
IMMEDIATELY THE QUESTION AROSE: WHAT THEN? TO REPUDIATE AND ABOLISH THE
VIENNA PARLIAMENT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN LEAVING ALL POWER IN THE HANDS
OF THE HABSBURGS. FOR ME, ESPECIALLY, THAT IDEA WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

SINCE THIS PROBLEM WAS SPECIALLY DIFFICULT IN REGARD TO AUSTRIA, I WAS
FORCED WHILE STILL QUITE YOUNG TO GO INTO THE ESSENTIALS OF THE WHOLE
QUESTION MORE THOROUGHLY THAN I OTHERWISE SHOULD HAVE DONE.

THE ASPECT OF THE SITUATION THAT FIRST MADE THE MOST STRIKING IMPRESSION
ON ME AND GAVE ME GROUNDS FOR SERIOUS REFLECTION WAS THE MANIFEST LACK
OF ANY INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY.

THE PARLIAMENT PASSES SOME ACTS OR DECREE WHICH MAY HAVE THE MOST
DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES, YET NOBODY BEARS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.
NOBODY CAN BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT. FOR SURELY ONE CANNOT SAY THAT A
CABINET DISCHARGES ITS RESPONSIBILITY WHEN IT RETIRES AFTER HAVING
BROUGHT ABOUT A CATASTROPHE. OR CAN WE SAY THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY IS
FULLY DISCHARGED WHEN A NEW COALITION IS FORMED OR PARLIAMENT DISSOLVED?
CAN THE PRINCIPLE OF RESPONSIBILITY MEAN ANYTHING ELSE THAN THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF A DEFINITE PERSON?

IS IT AT ALL POSSIBLE ACTUALLY TO CALL TO ACCOUNT THE LEADERS OF A
PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT FOR ANY KIND OF ACTION WHICH ORIGINATED IN THE
WISHES OF THE WHOLE MULTITUDE OF DEPUTIES AND WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER
THEIR ORDERS OR SANCTION? INSTEAD OF DEVELOPING CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS AND
PLANS, DOES THE BUSINESS OF A STATESMAN CONSIST IN THE ART OF MAKING A
WHOLE PACK OF BLOCKHEADS UNDERSTAND HIS PROJECTS? IS IT HIS BUSINESS TO
ENTREAT AND COACH THEM SO THAT THEY WILL GRANT HIM THEIR GENEROUS
CONSENT?

IS IT AN INDISPENSABLE QUALITY IN A STATESMAN THAT HE SHOULD POSSESS A
GIFT OF PERSUASION COMMENSURATE WITH THE STATESMAN'S ABILITY TO CONCEIVE
GREAT POLITICAL MEASURES AND CARRY THEM THROUGH INTO PRACTICE?

DOES IT REALLY PROVE THAT A STATESMAN IS INCOMPETENT IF HE SHOULD FAIL
TO WIN OVER A MAJORITY OF VOTES TO SUPPORT HIS POLICY IN AN ASSEMBLY
WHICH HAS BEEN CALLED TOGETHER AS THE CHANCE RESULT OF AN ELECTORAL
SYSTEM THAT IS NOT ALWAYS HONESTLY ADMINISTERED.

HAS THERE EVER BEEN A CASE WHERE SUCH AN ASSEMBLY HAS WORTHILY APPRAISED
A GREAT POLITICAL CONCEPT BEFORE THAT CONCEPT WAS PUT INTO PRACTICE AND
ITS GREATNESS OPENLY DEMONSTRATED THROUGH ITS SUCCESS?

IN THIS WORLD IS NOT THE CREATIVE ACT OF THE GENIUS ALWAYS A PROTEST
AGAINST THE INERTIA OF THE MASS?

WHAT SHALL THE STATESMAN DO IF HE DOES NOT SUCCEED IN COAXING THE
PARLIAMENTARY MULTITUDE TO GIVE ITS CONSENT TO HIS POLICY? SHALL HE
PURCHASE THAT CONSENT FOR SOME SORT OF CONSIDERATION?

OR, WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THE OBSTINATE STUPIDITY OF HIS FELLOW CITIZENS,
SHOULD HE THEN REFRAIN FROM PUSHING FORWARD THE MEASURES WHICH HE DEEMS
TO BE OF VITAL NECESSITY TO THE LIFE OF THE NATION? SHOULD HE RETIRE OR
REMAIN IN POWER?

IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES DOES NOT A MAN OF CHARACTER FIND HIMSELF FACE TO
FACE WITH AN INSOLUBLE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN HIS OWN POLITICAL INSIGHT
ON THE ONE HAND AND, ON THE OTHER, HIS MORAL INTEGRITY, OR, BETTER
STILL, HIS SENSE OF HONESTY?

WHERE CAN WE DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN PUBLIC DUTY AND PERSONAL HONOUR?

MUST NOT EVERY GENUINE LEADER RENOUNCE THE IDEA OF DEGRADING HIMSELF TO
THE LEVEL OF A POLITICAL JOBBER?

AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, DOES NOT EVERY JOBBER FEEL THE ITCH TO 'PLAY
POLITICS', SEEING THAT THE FINAL RESPONSIBILITY WILL NEVER REST WITH HIM
PERSONALLY BUT WITH AN ANONYMOUS MASS WHICH CAN NEVER BE CALLED TO
ACCOUNT FOR THEIR DEEDS?

MUST NOT OUR PARLIAMENTARY PRINCIPLE OF GOVERNMENT BY NUMERICAL MAJORITY
NECESSARILY LEAD TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEADERSHIP?

DOES ANYBODY HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT HUMAN PROGRESS ORIGINATES IN THE
COMPOSITE BRAIN OF THE MAJORITY AND NOT IN THE BRAIN OF THE INDIVIDUAL
PERSONALITY?

OR MAY IT BE PRESUMED THAT FOR THE FUTURE HUMAN CIVILIZATION WILL BE
ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH THIS AS A CONDITION OF ITS EXISTENCE?

BUT MAY IT NOT BE THAT, TO-DAY, MORE THAN EVER BEFORE, THE CREATIVE
BRAIN OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS INDISPENSABLE?

THE PARLIAMENTARY PRINCIPLE OF VESTING LEGISLATIVE POWER IN THE DECISION
OF THE MAJORITY REJECTS THE AUTHORITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND PUTS A
NUMERICAL QUOTA OF ANONYMOUS HEADS IN ITS PLACE. IN DOING SO IT
CONTRADICTS THE ARISTROCRATIC PRINCIPLE, WHICH IS A FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF
NATURE; BUT, OF COURSE, WE MUST REMEMBER THAT IN THIS DECADENT ERA OF
OURS THE ARISTROCRATIC PRINCIPLE NEED NOT BE THOUGHT OF AS INCORPORATED
IN THE UPPER TEN THOUSAND.

THE DEVASTATING INFLUENCE OF THIS PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTION MIGHT NOT
EASILY BE RECOGNIZED BY THOSE WHO READ THE JEWISH PRESS, UNLESS THE
READER HAS LEARNED HOW TO THINK INDEPENDENTLY AND EXAMINE THE FACTS FOR
HIMSELF. THIS INSTITUTION IS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CROWDED
INRUSH OF MEDIOCRE PEOPLE INTO THE FIELD OF POLITICS. CONFRONTED WITH
SUCH A PHENOMENON, A MAN WHO IS ENDOWED WITH REAL QUALITIES OF
LEADERSHIP WILL BE TEMPTED TO REFRAIN FROM TAKING PART IN POLITICAL
LIFE; BECAUSE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE SITUATION DOES NOT CALL FOR
A MAN WHO HAS A CAPACITY FOR CONSTRUCTIVE STATESMANSHIP BUT RATHER FOR A
MAN WHO IS CAPABLE OF BARGAINING FOR THE FAVOUR OF THE MAJORITY. THUS
THE SITUATION WILL APPEAL TO SMALL MINDS AND WILL ATTRACT THEM
ACCORDINGLY.

THE NARROWER THE MENTAL OUTLOOK AND THE MORE MEAGRE THE AMOUNT OF
KNOWLEDGE IN A POLITICAL JOBBER, THE MORE ACCURATE IS HIS ESTIMATE OF
HIS OWN POLITICAL STOCK, AND THUS HE WILL BE ALL THE MORE INCLINED TO
APPRECIATE A SYSTEM WHICH DOES NOT DEMAND CREATIVE GENIUS OR EVEN
HIGH-CLASS TALENT; BUT RATHER THAT CRAFTY KIND OF SAGACITY WHICH MAKES
AN EFFICIENT TOWN CLERK. INDEED, HE VALUES THIS KIND OF SMALL CRAFTINESS
MORE THAN THE POLITICAL GENIUS OF A PERICLES. SUCH A MEDIOCRITY DOES NOT
EVEN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HE DOES. FROM THE
BEGINNING HE KNOWS THAT WHATEVER BE THE RESULTS OF HIS 'STATESMANSHIP'
HIS END IS ALREADY PRESCRIBED BY THE STARS; HE WILL ONE DAY HAVE TO
CLEAR OUT AND MAKE ROOM FOR ANOTHER WHO IS OF SIMILAR MENTAL CALIBRE.
FOR IT IS ANOTHER SIGN OF OUR DECADENT TIMES THAT THE NUMBER OF EMINENT
STATESMEN GROWS ACCORDING AS THE CALIBRE OF INDIVIDUAL PERSONALITY
DWINDLES. THAT CALIBRE WILL BECOME SMALLER AND SMALLER THE MORE THE
INDIVIDUAL POLITICIAN HAS TO DEPEND UPON PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITIES. A MAN
OF REAL POLITICAL ABILITY WILL REFUSE TO BE THE BEADLE FOR A BEVY OF
FOOTLING CACKLERS; AND THEY IN THEIR TURN, BEING THE REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE MAJORITY--WHICH MEANS THE DUNDER-HEADED MULTITUDE--HATE NOTHING SO
MUCH AS A SUPERIOR BRAIN.

FOR FOOTLING DEPUTIES IT IS ALWAYS QUITE A CONSOLATION TO BE LED BY A
PERSON WHOSE INTELLECTUAL STATURE IS ON A LEVEL WITH THEIR OWN. THUS
EACH ONE MAY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHINE IN DEBATE AMONG SUCH COMPEERS
AND, ABOVE ALL, EACH ONE FEELS THAT HE MAY ONE DAY RISE TO THE TOP. IF
PETER BE BOSS TO-DAY, THEN WHY NOT PAUL TOMORROW?

THIS NEW INVENTION OF DEMOCRACY IS VERY CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH A
PECULIAR PHENOMENON WHICH HAS RECENTLY SPREAD TO A PERNICIOUS EXTENT,
NAMELY THE COWARDICE OF A LARGE SECTION OF OUR SO-CALLED POLITICAL
LEADERS. WHENEVER IMPORTANT DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE THEY ALWAYS FIND
THEMSELVES FORTUNATE IN BEING ABLE TO HIDE BEHIND THE BACKS OF WHAT THEY
CALL THE MAJORITY.

IN OBSERVING ONE OF THESE POLITICAL MANIPULATORS ONE NOTICES HOW HE
WHEEDLES THE MAJORITY IN ORDER TO GET THEIR SANCTION FOR WHATEVER ACTION
HE TAKES. HE HAS TO HAVE ACCOMPLICES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SHIFT
RESPONSIBILITY TO OTHER SHOULDERS WHENEVER IT IS OPPORTUNE TO DO SO.
THAT IS THE MAIN REASON WHY THIS KIND OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY IS ABHORRENT
TO MEN OF CHARACTER AND COURAGE, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME IT ATTRACTS
INFERIOR TYPES; FOR A PERSON WHO IS NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY
FOR HIS OWN ACTIONS, BUT IS ALWAYS SEEKING TO BE COVERED BY SOMETHING,
MUST BE CLASSED AMONG THE KNAVES AND THE RASCALS. IF A NATIONAL LEADER
SHOULD COME FROM THAT LOWER CLASS OF POLITICIANS THE EVIL CONSEQUENCES
WILL SOON MANIFEST THEMSELVES. NOBODY WILL THEN HAVE THE COURAGE TO TAKE
A DECISIVE STEP. THEY WILL SUBMIT TO ABUSE AND DEFAMATION RATHER THAN
PLUCK UP COURAGE TO TAKE A DEFINITE STAND. AND THUS NOBODY IS LEFT WHO
IS WILLING TO RISK HIS POSITION AND HIS CAREER, IF NEEDS BE, IN SUPPORT
OF A DETERMINED LINE OF POLICY.

ONE TRUTH WHICH MUST ALWAYS BE BORNE IN MIND IS THAT THE MAJORITY CAN
NEVER REPLACE THE MAN. THE MAJORITY REPRESENTS NOT ONLY IGNORANCE BUT
ALSO COWARDICE. AND JUST AS A HUNDRED BLOCKHEADS DO NOT EQUAL ONE MAN OF
WISDOM, SO A HUNDRED POLTROONS ARE INCAPABLE OF ANY POLITICAL LINE OF
ACTION THAT REQUIRES MORAL STRENGTH AND FORTITUDE.

THE LIGHTER THE BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY ON EACH INDIVIDUAL LEADER, THE
GREATER WILL BE THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO, IN SPITE OF THEIR SORRY
MEDIOCRITY, WILL FEEL THE CALL TO PLACE THEIR IMMORTAL ENERGIES AT THE
DISPOSAL OF THE NATION. THEY ARE SO MUCH ON THE TIP-TOE OF EXPECTATION
THAT THEY FIND IT HARD TO WAIT THEIR TURN. THEY STAND IN A LONG QUEUE,
PAINFULLY AND SADLY COUNTING THE NUMBER OF THOSE AHEAD OF THEM AND
CALCULATING THE HOURS UNTIL THEY MAY EVENTUALLY COME FORWARD. THEY WATCH
EVERY CHANGE THAT TAKES PLACE IN THE PERSONNEL OF THE OFFICE TOWARDS
WHICH THEIR HOPES ARE DIRECTED, AND THEY ARE GRATEFUL FOR EVERY SCANDAL
WHICH REMOVES ONE OF THE ASPIRANTS WAITING AHEAD OF THEM IN THE QUEUE.
IF SOMEBODY STICKS TOO LONG TO HIS OFFICE STOOL THEY CONSIDER THIS AS
ALMOST A BREACH OF A SACRED UNDERSTANDING BASED ON THEIR MUTUAL
SOLIDARITY. THEY GROW FURIOUS AND GIVE NO PEACE UNTIL THAT INCONSIDERATE
PERSON IS FINALLY DRIVEN OUT AND FORCED TO HAND OVER HIS COSY BERTH FOR
PUBLIC DISPOSAL. AFTER THAT HE WILL HAVE LITTLE CHANCE OF GETTING
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY. USUALLY THOSE PLACEMEN WHO HAVE BEEN FORCED TO GIVE
UP THEIR POSTS PUSH THEMSELVES AGAIN INTO THE WAITING QUEUE UNLESS THEY
ARE HOUNDED AWAY BY THE PROTESTATIONS OF THE OTHER ASPIRANTS.

THE RESULT OF ALL THIS IS THAT, IN SUCH A STATE, THE SUCCESSION OF
SUDDEN CHANGES IN PUBLIC POSITIONS AND PUBLIC OFFICES HAS A VERY
DISQUIETING EFFECT IN GENERAL, WHICH MAY EASILY LEAD TO DISASTER WHEN AN
ADVERSE CRISIS ARISES. IT IS NOT ONLY THE IGNORANT AND THE INCOMPETENT
PERSON WHO MAY FALL VICTIM TO THOSE PARLIAMENTARY CONDITIONS, FOR THE
GENUINE LEADER MAY BE AFFECTED JUST AS MUCH AS THE OTHERS, IF NOT MORE
SO, WHENEVER FATE HAS CHANCED TO PLACE A CAPABLE MAN IN THE POSITION OF
LEADER. LET THE SUPERIOR QUALITY OF SUCH A LEADER BE ONCE RECOGNIZED AND
THE RESULT WILL BE THAT A JOINT FRONT WILL BE ORGANIZED AGAINST HIM,
PARTICULARLY IF THAT LEADER, THOUGH NOT COMING FROM THEIR RANKS, SHOULD
FALL INTO THE HABIT OF INTERMINGLING WITH THESE ILLUSTRIOUS NINCOMPOOPS
ON THEIR OWN LEVEL. THEY WANT TO HAVE ONLY THEIR OWN COMPANY AND WILL
QUICKLY TAKE A HOSTILE ATTITUDE TOWARDS ANY MAN WHO MIGHT SHOW HIMSELF
OBVIOUSLY ABOVE AND BEYOND THEM WHEN HE MINGLES IN THEIR RANKS. THEIR
INSTINCT, WHICH IS SO BLIND IN OTHER DIRECTIONS, IS VERY SHARP IN THIS
PARTICULAR.

THE INEVITABLE RESULT IS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL LEVEL OF THE RULING CLASS
SINKS STEADILY. ONE CAN EASILY FORECAST HOW MUCH THE NATION AND STATE
ARE BOUND TO SUFFER FROM SUCH A CONDITION OF AFFAIRS, PROVIDED ONE DOES
NOT BELONG TO THAT SAME CLASS OF 'LEADERS'.

THE PARLIAMENTARY RÃ©GIME IN THE OLD AUSTRIA WAS THE VERY ARCHETYPE OF
THE INSTITUTION AS I HAVE DESCRIBED IT.

THOUGH THE AUSTRIAN PRIME MINISTER WAS APPOINTED BY THE KING-EMPEROR,
THIS ACT OF APPOINTMENT MERELY GAVE PRACTICAL EFFECT TO THE WILL OF THE
PARLIAMENT. THE HUCKSTERING AND BARGAINING THAT WENT ON IN REGARD TO
EVERY MINISTERIAL POSITION SHOWED ALL THE TYPICAL MARKS OF WESTERN
DEMOCRACY. THE RESULTS THAT FOLLOWED WERE IN KEEPING WITH THE PRINCIPLES
APPLIED. THE INTERVALS BETWEEN THE REPLACEMENT OF ONE PERSON BY ANOTHER
GRADUALLY BECAME SHORTER, FINALLY ENDING UP IN A WILD RELAY CHASE. WITH
EACH CHANGE THE QUALITY OF THE 'STATESMAN' IN QUESTION DETERIORATED,
UNTIL FINALLY ONLY THE PETTY TYPE OF POLITICAL HUCKSTER REMAINED. IN
SUCH PEOPLE THE QUALITIES OF STATESMANSHIP WERE MEASURED AND VALUED
ACCORDING TO THE ADROITNESS WITH WHICH THEY PIECED TOGETHER ONE
COALITION AFTER ANOTHER; IN OTHER WORDS, THEIR CRAFTINESS IN
MANIPULATING THE PETTIEST POLITICAL TRANSACTIONS, WHICH IS THE ONLY KIND
OF PRACTICAL ACTIVITY SUITED TO THE APTITUDES OF THESE REPRESENTATIVES.

IN THIS SPHERE VIENNA WAS THE SCHOOL WHICH OFFERED THE MOST IMPRESSIVE
EXAMPLES.

ANOTHER FEATURE THAT ENGAGED MY ATTENTION QUITE AS MUCH AS THE FEATURES
I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OF WAS THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE TALENTS AND
KNOWLEDGE OF THESE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE ON THE ONE HAND AND, ON
THE OTHER, THE NATURE OF THE TASKS THEY HAD TO FACE. WILLINGLY OR
UNWILLINGLY, ONE COULD NOT HELP THINKING SERIOUSLY OF THE NARROW
INTELLECTUAL OUTLOOK OF THESE CHOSEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE VARIOUS
CONSTITUENT NATIONALITIES, AND ONE COULD NOT AVOID PONDERING ON THE
METHODS THROUGH WHICH THESE NOBLE FIGURES IN OUR PUBLIC LIFE WERE FIRST
DISCOVERED.

IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO MAKE A THOROUGH STUDY AND EXAMINATION OF THE WAY
IN WHICH THE REAL TALENTS OF THESE GENTLEMEN WERE DEVOTED TO THE SERVICE
OF THEIR COUNTRY; IN OTHER WORDS, TO ANALYSE THOROUGHLY THE TECHNICAL
PROCEDURE OF THEIR ACTIVITIES.

THE WHOLE SPECTACLE OF PARLIAMENTARY LIFE BECAME MORE AND MORE DESOLATE
THE MORE ONE PENETRATED INTO ITS INTIMATE STRUCTURE AND STUDIED THE
PERSONS AND PRINCIPLES OF THE SYSTEM IN A SPIRIT OF RUTHLESS
OBJECTIVITY. INDEED, IT IS VERY NECESSARY TO BE STRICTLY OBJECTIVE IN
THE STUDY OF THE INSTITUTION WHOSE SPONSORS TALK OF 'OBJECTIVITY' IN
EVERY OTHER SENTENCE AS THE ONLY FAIR BASIS OF EXAMINATION AND JUDGMENT.
IF ONE STUDIED THESE GENTLEMEN AND THE LAWS OF THEIR STRENUOUS EXISTENCE
THE RESULTS WERE SURPRISING.

THERE IS NO OTHER PRINCIPLE WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE QUITE SO ILL-CONCEIVED
AS THE PARLIAMENTARY PRINCIPLE, IF WE EXAMINE IT OBJECTIVELY.

IN OUR EXAMINATION OF IT WE MAY PASS OVER THE METHODS ACCORDING TO WHICH
THE ELECTION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES TAKES PLACE, AS WELL AS THE WAYS
WHICH BRING THEM INTO OFFICE AND BESTOW NEW TITLES ON THEM. IT IS QUITE
EVIDENT THAT ONLY TO A TINY DEGREE ARE PUBLIC WISHES OR PUBLIC
NECESSITIES SATISFIED BY THE MANNER IN WHICH AN ELECTION TAKES PLACE;
FOR EVERYBODY WHO PROPERLY ESTIMATES THE POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE OF THE
MASSES CAN EASILY SEE THAT THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY DEVELOPED TO ENABLE
THEM TO FORM GENERAL POLITICAL JUDGMENTS ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT, OR TO
SELECT THE MEN WHO MIGHT BE COMPETENT TO CARRY OUT THEIR IDEAS IN
PRACTICE.

WHATEVER DEFINITION WE MAY GIVE OF THE TERM 'PUBLIC OPINION', ONLY A
VERY SMALL PART OF IT ORIGINATES FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OR INDIVIDUAL
INSIGHT. THE GREATER PORTION OF IT RESULTS FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH
PUBLIC MATTERS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO THE PEOPLE THROUGH AN
OVERWHELMINGLY IMPRESSIVE AND PERSISTENT SYSTEM OF 'INFORMATION'.

IN THE RELIGIOUS SPHERE THE PROFESSION OF A DENOMINATIONAL BELIEF IS
LARGELY THE RESULT OF EDUCATION, WHILE THE RELIGIOUS YEARNING ITSELF
SLUMBERS IN THE SOUL; SO TOO THE POLITICAL OPINIONS OF THE MASSES ARE
THE FINAL RESULT OF INFLUENCES SYSTEMATICALLY OPERATING ON HUMAN
SENTIMENT AND INTELLIGENCE IN VIRTUE OF A METHOD WHICH IS APPLIED
SOMETIMES WITH ALMOST-INCREDIBLE THOROUGHNESS AND PERSEVERANCE.

BY FAR THE MOST EFFECTIVE BRANCH OF POLITICAL EDUCATION, WHICH IN THIS
CONNECTION IS BEST EXPRESSED BY THE WORD 'PROPAGANDA', IS CARRIED ON BY
THE PRESS. THE PRESS IS THE CHIEF MEANS EMPLOYED IN THE PROCESS OF
POLITICAL 'ENLIGHTENMENT'. IT REPRESENTS A KIND OF SCHOOL FOR ADULTS.
THIS EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY, HOWEVER, IS NOT IN THE HANDS OF THE STATE BUT
IN THE CLUTCHES OF POWERS WHICH ARE PARTLY OF A VERY INFERIOR CHARACTER.
WHILE STILL A YOUNG MAN IN VIENNA I HAD EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR
COMING TO KNOW THE MEN WHO OWNED THIS MACHINE FOR MASS INSTRUCTION, AS
WELL AS THOSE WHO SUPPLIED IT WITH THE IDEAS IT DISTRIBUTED. AT FIRST I
WAS QUITE SURPRISED WHEN I REALIZED HOW LITTLE TIME WAS NECESSARY FOR
THIS DANGEROUS GREAT POWER WITHIN THE STATE TO PRODUCE A CERTAIN BELIEF
AMONG THE PUBLIC; AND IN DOING SO THE GENUINE WILL AND CONVICTIONS OF
THE PUBLIC WERE OFTEN COMPLETELY MISCONSTRUED. IT TOOK THE PRESS ONLY A
FEW DAYS TO TRANSFORM SOME RIDICULOUSLY TRIVIAL MATTER INTO AN ISSUE OF
NATIONAL IMPORTANCE, WHILE VITAL PROBLEMS WERE COMPLETELY IGNORED OR
FILCHED AND HIDDEN AWAY FROM PUBLIC ATTENTION.

THE PRESS SUCCEEDED IN THE MAGICAL ART OF PRODUCING NAMES FROM NOWHERE
WITHIN THE COURSE OF A FEW WEEKS. THEY MADE IT APPEAR THAT THE GREAT
HOPES OF THE MASSES WERE BOUND UP WITH THOSE NAMES. AND SO THEY MADE
THOSE NAMES MORE POPULAR THAN ANY MAN OF REAL ABILITY COULD EVER HOPE TO
BE IN A LONG LIFETIME. ALL THIS WAS DONE, DESPITE THE FACT THAT SUCH
NAMES WERE UTTERLY UNKNOWN AND INDEED HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD OF EVEN UP TO
A MONTH BEFORE THE PRESS PUBLICLY EMBLAZONED THEM. AT THE SAME TIME OLD
AND TRIED FIGURES IN THE POLITICAL AND OTHER SPHERES OF LIFE QUICKLY
FADED FROM THE PUBLIC MEMORY AND WERE FORGOTTEN AS IF THEY WERE DEAD,
THOUGH STILL HEALTHY AND IN THE ENJOYMENT OF THEIR FULL VIGUOUR. OR
SOMETIMES SUCH MEN WERE SO VILELY ABUSED THAT IT LOOKED AS IF THEIR
NAMES WOULD SOON STAND AS PERMANENT SYMBOLS OF THE WORST KIND OF
BASENESS. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE PROPERLY THE REALLY PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE
WHICH THE PRESS CAN EXERCISE ONE HAD TO STUDY THIS INFAMOUS JEWISH
METHOD WHEREBY HONOURABLE AND DECENT PEOPLE WERE BESMIRCHED WITH MUD AND
FILTH, IN THE FORM OF LOW ABUSE AND SLANDER, FROM HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS
OF QUARTERS SIMULTANEOUSLY, AS IF COMMANDED BY SOME MAGIC FORMULA.

THESE HIGHWAY ROBBERS WOULD GRAB AT ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT SERVE THEIR
EVIL ENDS.

THEY WOULD POKE THEIR NOSES INTO THE MOST INTIMATE FAMILY AFFAIRS AND
WOULD NOT REST UNTIL THEY HAD SNIFFED OUT SOME PETTY ITEM WHICH COULD BE
USED TO DESTROY THE REPUTATION OF THEIR VICTIM. BUT IF THE RESULT OF ALL
THIS SNIFFING SHOULD BE THAT NOTHING DEROGATORY WAS DISCOVERED IN THE
PRIVATE OR PUBLIC LIFE OF THE VICTIM, THEY CONTINUED TO HURL ABUSE AT
HIM, IN THE BELIEF THAT SOME OF THEIR ANIMADVERSIONS WOULD STICK EVEN
THOUGH REFUTED A THOUSAND TIMES. IN MOST CASES IT FINALLY TURNED OUT
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE VICTIM TO CONTINUE HIS DEFENCE, BECAUSE THE ACCUSER
WORKED TOGETHER WITH SO MANY ACCOMPLICES THAT HIS SLANDERS WERE
RE-ECHOED INTERMINABLY. BUT THESE SLANDERERS WOULD NEVER OWN THAT THEY
WERE ACTING FROM MOTIVES WHICH INFLUENCE THE COMMON RUN OF HUMANITY OR
ARE UNDERSTOOD BY THEM. OH, NO. THE SCOUNDREL WHO DEFAMED HIS
CONTEMPORARIES IN THIS VILLAINOUS WAY WOULD CROWN HIMSELF WITH A HALO OF
HEROIC PROBITY FASHIONED OF UNCTUOUS PHRASEOLOGY AND TWADDLE ABOUT HIS
'DUTIES AS A JOURNALIST' AND OTHER MOULDY NONSENSE OF THAT KIND. WHEN
THESE CUTTLE-FISHES GATHERED TOGETHER IN LARGE SHOALS AT MEETINGS AND
CONGRESSES THEY WOULD GIVE OUT A LOT OF SLIMY TALK ABOUT A SPECIAL KIND
OF HONOUR WHICH THEY CALLED THE PROFESSIONAL HONOUR OF THE JOURNALIST.
THEN THE ASSEMBLED SPECIES WOULD BOW THEIR RESPECTS TO ONE ANOTHER.

THESE ARE THE KIND OF BEINGS THAT FABRICATE MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS OF WHAT
IS CALLED PUBLIC OPINION, FROM THE FOAM OF WHICH THE PARLIAMENTARY
APHRODITE EVENTUALLY ARISES.

SEVERAL VOLUMES WOULD BE NEEDED IF ONE WERE TO GIVE AN ADEQUATE ACCOUNT
OF THE WHOLE PROCEDURE AND FULLY DESCRIBE ALL ITS HOLLOW FALLACIES. BUT
IF WE PASS OVER THE DETAILS AND LOOK AT THE PRODUCT ITSELF WHILE IT IS
IN OPERATION I THINK THIS ALONE WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO OPEN THE EYES OF
EVEN THE MOST INNOCENT AND CREDULOUS PERSON, SO THAT HE MAY RECOGNIZE
THE ABSURDITY OF THIS INSTITUTION BY LOOKING AT IT OBJECTIVELY.

IN ORDER TO REALIZE HOW THIS HUMAN ABERRATION IS AS HARMFUL AS IT IS
ABSURD, THE TEST AND EASIEST METHOD IS TO COMPARE DEMOCRATIC
PARLIAMENTARIANISM WITH A GENUINE GERMAN DEMOCRACY.

THE REMARKABLE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PARLIAMENTARY FORM OF DEMOCRACY IS
THE FACT THAT A NUMBER OF PERSONS, LET US SAY FIVE HUNDRED--INCLUDING,
IN RECENT TIME, WOMEN ALSO--ARE ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT AND INVESTED WITH
AUTHORITY TO GIVE FINAL JUDGMENT ON ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. IN PRACTICE
THEY ALONE ARE THE GOVERNING BODY; FOR ALTHOUGH THEY MAY APPOINT A
CABINET, WHICH SEEMS OUTWARDLY TO DIRECT THE AFFAIRS OF STATE, THIS
CABINET HAS NOT A REAL EXISTENCE OF ITS OWN. IN REALITY THE SO-CALLED
GOVERNMENT CANNOT DO ANYTHING AGAINST THE WILL OF THE ASSEMBLY. IT CAN
NEVER BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT FOR ANYTHING, SINCE THE RIGHT OF DECISION IS
NOT VESTED IN THE CABINET BUT IN THE PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY. THE CABINET
ALWAYS FUNCTIONS ONLY AS THE EXECUTOR OF THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY. ITS
POLITICAL ABILITY CAN BE JUDGED ONLY ACCORDING TO HOW FAR IT SUCCEEDS IN
ADJUSTING ITSELF TO THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY OR IN PERSUADING THE
MAJORITY TO AGREE TO ITS PROPOSALS. BUT THIS MEANS THAT IT MUST DESCEND
FROM THE LEVEL OF A REAL GOVERNING POWER TO THAT OF A MENDICANT WHO HAS
TO BEG THE APPROVAL OF A MAJORITY THAT MAY BE GOT TOGETHER FOR THE TIME
BEING. INDEED, THE CHIEF PREOCCUPATION OF THE CABINET MUST BE TO SECURE
FOR ITSELF, IN THE CASE OF' EACH INDIVIDUAL MEASURE, THE FAVOUR OF THE
MAJORITY THEN IN POWER OR, FAILING THAT, TO FORM A NEW MAJORITY THAT
WILL BE MORE FAVOURABLY DISPOSED. IF IT SHOULD SUCCEED IN EITHER OF
THESE EFFORTS IT MAY GO ON 'GOVERNING' FOR A LITTLE WHILE. IF IT SHOULD
FAIL TO WIN OR FORM A MAJORITY IT MUST RETIRE. THE QUESTION WHETHER ITS
POLICY AS SUCH HAS BEEN RIGHT OR WRONG DOES NOT MATTER AT ALL.

THEREBY ALL RESPONSIBILITY IS ABOLISHED IN PRACTICE. TO WHAT
CONSEQUENCES SUCH A STATE OF AFFAIRS CAN LEAD MAY EASILY BE UNDERSTOOD
FROM THE FOLLOWING SIMPLE CONSIDERATIONS:

THOSE FIVE HUNDRED DEPUTIES WHO HAVE BEEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE COME
FROM VARIOUS DISSIMILAR CALLINGS IN LIFE AND SHOW VERY VARYING DEGREES
OF POLITICAL CAPACITY, WITH THE RESULT THAT THE WHOLE COMBINATION IS
DISJOINTED AND SOMETIMES PRESENTS QUITE A SORRY PICTURE. SURELY NOBODY
BELIEVES THAT THESE CHOSEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION ARE THE CHOICE
SPIRITS OR FIRST-CLASS INTELLECTS. NOBODY, I HOPE, IS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO
PRETEND THAT HUNDREDS OF STATESMEN CAN EMERGE FROM PAPERS PLACED IN THE
BALLOT BOX BY ELECTORS WHO ARE ANYTHING ELSE BUT AVERAGELY INTELLIGENT.
THE ABSURD NOTION THAT MEN OF GENIUS ARE BORN OUT OF UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE
CANNOT BE TOO STRONGLY REPUDIATED. IN THE FIRST PLACE, THOSE TIMES MAY
BE REALLY CALLED BLESSED WHEN ONE GENUINE STATESMAN MAKES HIS APPEARANCE
AMONG A PEOPLE. SUCH STATESMEN DO NOT APPEAR ALL AT ONCE IN HUNDREDS OR
MORE. SECONDLY, AMONG THE BROAD MASSES THERE IS INSTINCTIVELY A DEFINITE
ANTIPATHY TOWARDS EVERY OUTSTANDING GENIUS. THERE IS A BETTER CHANCE OF
SEEING A CAMEL PASS THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE THAN OF SEEING A REALLY
GREAT MAN 'DISCOVERED' THROUGH AN ELECTION.

WHATEVER HAS HAPPENED IN HISTORY ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE AVERAGE OF THE
BROAD PUBLIC HAS MOSTLY BEEN DUE TO THE DRIVING FORCE OF AN INDIVIDUAL
PERSONALITY.

BUT HERE FIVE HUNDRED PERSONS OF LESS THAN MODEST INTELLECTUAL QUALITIES
PASS JUDGMENT ON THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE NATION. THEY
FORM GOVERNMENTS WHICH IN TURN LEARN TO WIN THE APPROVAL OF THE
ILLUSTRIOUS ASSEMBLY FOR EVERY LEGISLATIVE STEP THAT MAY BE TAKEN, WHICH
MEANS THAT THE POLICY TO BE CARRIED OUT IS ACTUALLY THE POLICY OF THE
FIVE HUNDRED.

AND INDEED, GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE POLICY BEARS THE STAMP OF ITS
ORIGIN.

BUT LET US PASS OVER THE INTELLECTUAL QUALITIES OF THESE REPRESENTATIVES
AND ASK WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE TASK SET BEFORE THEM. IF WE CONSIDER
THE FACT THAT THE PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED AND SOLVED BELONG
TO THE MOST VARIED AND DIVERSE FIELDS WE CAN VERY WELL REALIZE HOW
INEFFICIENT A GOVERNING SYSTEM MUST BE WHICH ENTRUSTS THE RIGHT OF
DECISION TO A MASS ASSEMBLY IN WHICH ONLY VERY FEW POSSESS THE KNOWLEDGE
AND EXPERIENCE SUCH AS WOULD QUALIFY THEM TO DEAL WITH THE MATTERS THAT
HAVE TO BE SETTLED. THE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC MEASURES ARE SUBMITTED
TO A TRIBUNAL IN WHICH NOT MORE THAN ONE-TENTH OF THE MEMBERS HAVE
STUDIED THE ELEMENTS OF ECONOMICS. THIS MEANS THAT FINAL AUTHORITY IS
VESTED IN MEN WHO ARE UTTERLY DEVOID OF ANY PREPARATORY TRAINING WHICH
MIGHT MAKE THEM COMPETENT TO DECIDE ON THE QUESTIONS AT ISSUE.

THE SAME HOLDS TRUE OF EVERY OTHER PROBLEM. IT IS ALWAYS A MAJORITY OF
IGNORANT AND INCOMPETENT PEOPLE WHO DECIDE ON EACH MEASURE; FOR THE
COMPOSITION OF THE INSTITUTION DOES NOT VARY, WHILE THE PROBLEMS TO BE
DEALT WITH COME FROM THE MOST VARIED SPHERES OF PUBLIC LIFE. AN
INTELLIGENT JUDGMENT WOULD BE POSSIBLE ONLY IF DIFFERENT DEPUTIES HAD
THE AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH DIFFERENT ISSUES. IT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION
TO THINK THAT THE SAME PEOPLE ARE FITTED TO DECIDE ON TRANSPORT
QUESTIONS AS WELL AS, LET US SAY, ON QUESTIONS OF FOREIGN POLICY, UNLESS
EACH OF THEM BE A UNIVERSAL GENIUS. BUT SCARCELY MORE THAN ONE GENIUS
APPEARS IN A CENTURY. HERE WE ARE SCARCELY EVER DEALING WITH REAL
BRAINS, BUT ONLY WITH DILETTANTI WHO ARE AS NARROW-MINDED AS THEY ARE
CONCEITED AND ARROGANT, INTELLECTUAL DEMI-MONDES OF THE WORST KIND. THIS
IS WHY THESE HONOURABLE GENTLEMEN SHOW SUCH ASTONISHING LEVITY IN
DISCUSSING AND DECIDING ON MATTERS THAT WOULD DEMAND THE MOST
PAINSTAKING CONSIDERATION EVEN FROM GREAT MINDS. MEASURES OF MOMENTOUS
IMPORTANCE FOR THE FUTURE EXISTENCE OF THE STATE ARE FRAMED AND
DISCUSSED IN AN ATMOSPHERE MORE SUITED TO THE CARD-TABLE. INDEED THE
LATTER SUGGESTS A MUCH MORE FITTING OCCUPATION FOR THESE GENTLEMEN THAN
THAT OF DECIDING THE DESTINIES OF A PEOPLE.

OF COURSE IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO ASSUME THAT EACH MEMBER IN SUCH A
PARLIAMENT WAS ENDOWED BY NATURE WITH SUCH A SMALL SENSE OF
RESPONSIBILITY. THAT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION.

BUT THIS SYSTEM, BY FORCING THE INDIVIDUAL TO PASS JUDGMENT ON QUESTIONS
FOR WHICH HE IS NOT COMPETENT GRADUALLY DEBASES HIS MORAL CHARACTER.
NOBODY WILL HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY: "GENTLEMEN, I AM AFRAID WE KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. I FOR ONE HAVE NO COMPETENCY IN
THE MATTER AT ALL." ANYHOW IF SUCH A DECLARATION WERE MADE IT WOULD NOT
CHANGE MATTERS VERY MUCH; FOR SUCH OUTSPOKEN HONESTY WOULD NOT BE
UNDERSTOOD. THE PERSON WHO MADE THE DECLARATION WOULD BE DEEMED AN
HONOURABLE ASS WHO OUGHT NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO SPOIL THE GAME. THOSE WHO
HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE KNOW THAT NOBODY LIKES TO BE CONSIDERED
A FOOL AMONG HIS ASSOCIATES; AND IN CERTAIN CIRCLES HONESTY IS TAKEN AS
AN INDEX OF STUPIDITY.

THUS IT HAPPENS THAT A NATURALLY UPRIGHT MAN, ONCE HE FINDS HIMSELF
ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT, MAY EVENTUALLY BE INDUCED BY THE FORCE OF
CIRCUMSTANCES TO ACQUIESCE IN A GENERAL LINE OF CONDUCT WHICH IS BASE IN
ITSELF AND AMOUNTS TO A BETRAYAL OF THE PUBLIC TRUST. THAT FEELING THAT
IF THE INDIVIDUAL REFRAINED FROM TAKING PART IN A CERTAIN DECISION HIS
ATTITUDE WOULD NOT ALTER THE SITUATION IN THE LEAST, DESTROYS EVERY REAL
SENSE OF HONOUR WHICH MIGHT OCCASIONALLY AROUSE THE CONSCIENCE OF ONE
PERSON OR ANOTHER. FINALLY, THE OTHERWISE UPRIGHT DEPUTY WILL SUCCEED IN
PERSUADING HIMSELF THAT HE IS BY NO MEANS THE WORST OF THE LOT AND THAT
BY TAKING PART IN A CERTAIN LINE OF ACTION HE MAY PREVENT SOMETHING
WORSE FROM HAPPENING.

A COUNTER ARGUMENT MAY BE PUT FORWARD HERE. IT MAY BE SAID THAT OF
COURSE THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBER MAY NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS
REQUISITE FOR THE TREATMENT OF THIS OR THAT QUESTION, YET HIS ATTITUDE
TOWARDS IT IS TAKEN ON THE ADVICE OF HIS PARTY AS THE GUIDING AUTHORITY
IN EACH POLITICAL MATTER; AND IT MAY FURTHER BE SAID THAT THE PARTY SETS
UP SPECIAL COMMITTEES OF EXPERTS WHO HAVE EVEN MORE THAN THE REQUISITE
KNOWLEDGE FOR DEALING WITH THE QUESTIONS PLACED BEFORE THEM.

AT FIRST SIGHT, THAT ARGUMENT SEEMS SOUND. BUT THEN ANOTHER QUESTION
ARISES--NAMELY, WHY ARE FIVE HUNDRED PERSONS ELECTED IF ONLY A FEW HAVE
THE WISDOM WHICH IS REQUIRED TO DEAL WITH THE MORE IMPORTANT PROBLEMS?

IT IS NOT THE AIM OF OUR MODERN DEMOCRATIC PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM TO BRING
TOGETHER AN ASSEMBLY OF INTELLIGENT AND WELL-INFORMED DEPUTIES. NOT AT
ALL. THE AIM RATHER IS TO BRING TOGETHER A GROUP OF NONENTITIES WHO ARE
DEPENDENT ON OTHERS FOR THEIR VIEWS AND WHO CAN BE ALL THE MORE EASILY
LED, THE NARROWER THE MENTAL OUTLOOK OF EACH INDIVIDUAL IS. THAT IS THE
ONLY WAY IN WHICH A PARTY POLICY, ACCORDING TO THE EVIL MEANING IT HAS
TO-DAY, CAN BE PUT INTO EFFECT. AND BY THIS METHOD ALONE IT IS POSSIBLE
FOR THE WIREPULLER, WHO EXERCISES THE REAL CONTROL, TO REMAIN IN THE
DARK, SO THAT PERSONALLY HE CAN NEVER BE BROUGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS
ACTIONS. FOR UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES NONE OF THE DECISIONS TAKEN, NO
MATTER HOW DISASTROUS THEY MAY TURN OUT FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE, CAN
BE LAID AT THE DOOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHOM EVERYBODY KNOWS TO BE THE
EVIL GENIUS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WHOLE AFFAIR. ALL RESPONSIBILITY IS
SHIFTED TO THE SHOULDERS OF THE PARTY AS A WHOLE.

IN PRACTICE NO ACTUAL RESPONSIBILITY REMAINS. FOR RESPONSIBILITY ARISES
ONLY FROM PERSONAL DUTY AND NOT FROM THE OBLIGATIONS THAT REST WITH A
PARLIAMENTARY ASSEMBLY OF EMPTY TALKERS.

THE PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTION ATTRACTS PEOPLE OF THE BADGER TYPE, WHO DO
NOT LIKE THE OPEN LIGHT. NO UPRIGHT MAN, WHO IS READY TO ACCEPT PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS ACTS, WILL BE ATTRACTED TO SUCH AN INSTITUTION.

THAT IS THE REASON WHY THIS BRAND OF DEMOCRACY HAS BECOME A TOOL IN THE
HAND OF THAT RACE WHICH, BECAUSE OF THE INNER PURPOSES IT WISHES TO
ATTAIN, MUST SHUN THE OPEN LIGHT, AS IT HAS ALWAYS DONE AND ALWAYS WILL
DO. ONLY A JEW CAN PRAISE AN INSTITUTION WHICH IS AS CORRUPT AND FALSE
AS HIMSELF.

AS A CONTRAST TO THIS KIND OF DEMOCRACY WE HAVE THE GERMAN DEMOCRACY,
WHICH IS A TRUE DEMOCRACY; FOR HERE THE LEADER IS FREELY CHOSEN AND IS
OBLIGED TO ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL HIS ACTIONS AND OMISSIONS.
THE PROBLEMS TO BE DEALT WITH ARE NOT PUT TO THE VOTE OF THE MAJORITY;
BUT THEY ARE DECIDED UPON BY THE INDIVIDUAL, AND AS A GUARANTEE OF
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE DECISIONS HE PLEDGES ALL HE HAS IN THE WORLD
AND EVEN HIS LIFE.

THE OBJECTION MAY BE RAISED HERE THAT UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS IT WOULD BE
VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND A MAN WHO WOULD BE READY TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO SO
FATEFUL A TASK. THE ANSWER TO THAT OBJECTION IS AS FOLLOWS:

WE THANK GOD THAT THE INNER SPIRIT OF OUR GERMAN DEMOCRACY WILL OF
ITSELF PREVENT THE CHANCE CAREERIST, WHO MAY BE INTELLECTUALLY WORTHLESS
AND A MORAL TWISTER, FROM COMING BY DEVIOUS WAYS TO A POSITION IN WHICH
HE MAY GOVERN HIS FELLOW-CITIZENS. THE FEAR OF UNDERTAKING SUCH
FAR-REACHING RESPONSIBILITIES, UNDER GERMAN DEMOCRACY, WILL SCARE OFF
THE IGNORANT AND THE FECKLESS.

BUT SHOULD IT HAPPEN THAT SUCH A PERSON MIGHT CREEP IN SURREPTITIOUSLY
IT WILL BE EASY ENOUGH TO IDENTIFY HIM AND APOSTROPHIZE HIM RUTHLESSLY.
SOMEWHAT THUS: "BE OFF, YOU SCOUNDREL. DON'T SOIL THESE STEPS WITH YOUR
FEET; BECAUSE THESE ARE THE STEPS THAT LEAD TO THE PORTALS OF THE
PANTHEON OF HISTORY, AND THEY ARE NOT MEANT FOR PLACE-HUNTERS BUT FOR
MEN OF NOBLE CHARACTER."

SUCH WERE THE VIEWS I FORMED AFTER TWO YEARS OF ATTENDANCE AT THE
SESSIONS OF THE VIENNESE PARLIAMENT. THEN I WENT THERE NO MORE.

THE PARLIAMENTARY REGIME BECAME ONE OF THE CAUSES WHY THE STRENGTH OF
THE HABSBURG STATE STEADILY DECLINED DURING THE LAST YEARS OF ITS
EXISTENCE. THE MORE THE PREDOMINANCE OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT WAS WHITTLED
AWAY THROUGH PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE, THE MORE PROMINENT BECAME THE
SYSTEM OF PLAYING OFF ONE OF THE VARIOUS CONSTITUENT NATIONALITIES
AGAINST THE OTHER. IN THE IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT IT WAS ALWAYS THE GERMAN
ELEMENT THAT SUFFERED THROUGH THE SYSTEM, WHICH MEANT THAT THE RESULTS
WERE DETRIMENTAL TO THE EMPIRE AS A WHOLE; FOR AT THE CLOSE OF THE
CENTURY EVEN THE MOST SIMPLE-MINDED PEOPLE COULD RECOGNIZE THAT THE
COHESIVE FORCES WITHIN THE DUAL MONARCHY NO LONGER SUFFICED TO
COUNTERBALANCE THE SEPARATIST TENDENCIES OF THE PROVINCIAL
NATIONALITIES. ON THE CONTRARY!

THE MEASURES WHICH THE STATE ADOPTED FOR ITS OWN MAINTENANCE BECAME MORE
AND MORE MEAN SPIRITED AND IN A LIKE DEGREE THE GENERAL DISRESPECT FOR
THE STATE INCREASED. NOT ONLY HUNGARY BUT ALSO THE VARIOUS SLAV
PROVINCES GRADUALLY CEASED TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WITH THE MONARCHY
WHICH EMBRACED THEM ALL, AND ACCORDINGLY THEY DID NOT FEEL ITS WEAKNESS
AS IN ANY WAY DETRIMENTAL TO THEMSELVES. THEY RATHER WELCOMED THOSE
MANIFESTATIONS OF SENILE DECAY. THEY LOOKED FORWARD TO THE FINAL
DISSOLUTION OF THE STATE, AND NOT TO ITS RECOVERY.

THE COMPLETE COLLAPSE WAS STILL FORESTALLED IN PARLIAMENT BY THE
HUMILIATING CONCESSIONS THAT WERE MADE TO EVERY KIND OF IMPORTUNATE
DEMANDS, AT THE COST OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT. THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THE
DEFENCE OF THE STATE RESTED ON PLAYING OFF THE VARIOUS NATIONALITIES
AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. BUT THE GENERAL TREND OF THIS DEVELOPMENT WAS
DIRECTED AGAINST THE GERMANS. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE RIGHT OF SUCCESSION
TO THE THRONE CONFERRED CERTAIN INFLUENCE ON THE ARCHDUKE FRANZ
FERDINAND, THE POLICY OF INCREASING THE POWER OF THE CZECHS WAS CARRIED
OUT SYSTEMATICALLY FROM THE UPPER GRADES OF THE ADMINISTRATION DOWN TO
THE LOWER. WITH ALL THE MEANS AT HIS COMMAND THE HEIR TO THE DUAL
MONARCHY PERSONALLY FURTHERED THE POLICY THAT AIMED AT ELIMINATING THE
INFLUENCE OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT, OR AT LEAST HE ACTED AS PROTECTOR OF
THAT POLICY. BY THE USE OF STATE OFFICIALS AS TOOLS, PURELY GERMAN
DISTRICTS WERE GRADUALLY BUT DECISIVELY BROUGHT WITHIN THE DANGER ZONE
OF THE MIXED LANGUAGES. EVEN IN LOWER AUSTRIA THIS PROCESS BEGAN TO MAKE
HEADWAY WITH A CONSTANTLY INCREASING TEMPO AND VIENNA WAS LOOKED UPON BY
THE CZECHS AS THEIR BIGGEST CITY.

IN THE FAMILY CIRCLE OF THIS NEW HABSBURGER THE CZECH LANGUAGE WAS
FAVOURED. THE WIFE OF THE ARCHDUKE HAD FORMERLY BEEN A CZECH COUNTESS
AND WAS WEDDED TO THE PRINCE BY A MORGANATIC MARRIAGE. SHE CAME FROM AN
ENVIRONMENT WHERE HOSTILITY TO THE GERMANS HAD BEEN TRADITIONAL. THE
LEADING IDEA IN THE MIND OF THE ARCHDUKE WAS TO ESTABLISH A SLAV STATE
IN CENTRAL EUROPE, WHICH WAS TO BE CONSTRUCTED ON A PURELY CATHOLIC
BASIS, SO AS TO SERVE AS A BULWARK AGAINST ORTHODOX RUSSIA.

AS HAD HAPPENED OFTEN IN HABSBURG HISTORY, RELIGION WAS THUS EXPLOITED
TO SERVE A PURELY POLITICAL POLICY, AND IN THIS CASE A FATAL POLICY, AT
LEAST AS FAR AS GERMAN INTERESTS WERE CONCERNED. THE RESULT WAS
LAMENTABLE IN MANY RESPECTS.

NEITHER THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG NOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH RECEIVED THE
REWARD WHICH THEY EXPECTED. HABSBURG LOST THE THRONE AND THE CHURCH LOST
A GREAT STATE. BY EMPLOYING RELIGIOUS MOTIVES IN THE SERVICE OF
POLITICS, A SPIRIT WAS AROUSED WHICH THE INSTIGATORS OF THAT POLICY HAD
NEVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

FROM THE ATTEMPT TO EXTERMINATE GERMANISM IN THE OLD MONARCHY BY EVERY
AVAILABLE MEANS AROSE THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT IN AUSTRIA, AS A RESPONSE.

IN THE 'EIGHTIES OF THE LAST CENTURY MANCHESTER LIBERALISM, WHICH WAS
JEWISH IN ITS FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS, HAD REACHED THE ZENITH OF ITS INFLUENCE
IN THE DUAL MONARCHY, OR HAD ALREADY PASSED THAT POINT. THE REACTION
WHICH SET IN DID NOT ARISE FROM SOCIAL BUT FROM NATIONALISTIC
TENDENCIES, AS WAS ALWAYS THE CASE IN THE OLD AUSTRIA. THE INSTINCT OF
SELF-PRESERVATION DROVE THE GERMAN ELEMENT TO DEFEND ITSELF
ENERGETICALLY. ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS ONLY SLOWLY BEGAN TO GAIN AN
IMPORTANT INFLUENCE; BUT THEY WERE OF SECONDARY CONCERN. BUT OF THE
GENERAL POLITICAL CHAOS TWO PARTY ORGANIZATIONS EMERGED. THE ONE WAS
MORE OF A NATIONAL, AND THE OTHER MORE OF A SOCIAL, CHARACTER; BUT BOTH
WERE HIGHLY INTERESTING AND INSTRUCTIVE FOR THE FUTURE.

AFTER THE WAR OF 1866, WHICH HAD RESULTED IN THE HUMILIATION OF AUSTRIA,
THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG CONTEMPLATED A REVANCHE ON THE BATTLEFIELD. ONLY
THE TRAGIC END OF THE EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN OF MEXICO PREVENTED A STILL
CLOSER COLLABORATION WITH FRANCE. THE CHIEF BLAME FOR MAXIMILIAN'S
DISASTROUS EXPEDITION WAS ATTRIBUTED TO NAPOLEON III AND THE FACT THAT
THE FRENCHMAN LEFT HIM IN THE LURCH AROUSED A GENERAL FEELING OF
INDIGNATION. YET THE HABSBURGS WERE STILL LYING IN WAIT FOR THEIR
OPPORTUNITY. IF THE WAR OF 1870-71 HAD NOT BEEN SUCH A SINGULAR TRIUMPH,
THE VIENNESE COURT MIGHT HAVE CHANCED THE GAME OF BLOOD IN ORDER TO GET
ITS REVENGE FOR SADOWA. BUT WHEN THE FIRST REPORTS ARRIVED FROM THE
FRANCO-GERMAN BATTLEFIELD, WHICH, THOUGH TRUE, SEEMED MIRACULOUS AND
ALMOST INCREDIBLE, THE 'MOST WISE' OF ALL MONARCHS RECOGNIZED THAT THE
MOMENT WAS INOPPORTUNE AND TRIED TO ACCEPT THE UNFAVOURABLE SITUATION
WITH AS GOOD A GRACE AS POSSIBLE.

THE HEROIC CONFLICT OF THOSE TWO YEARS (1870-71) PRODUCED A STILL
GREATER MIRACLE; FOR WITH THE HABSBURGS THE CHANGE OF ATTITUDE NEVER
CAME FROM AN INNER HEARTFELT URGE BUT ONLY FROM THE PRESSURE OF
CIRCUMSTANCES. THE GERMAN PEOPLE OF THE EAST MARK, HOWEVER, WERE
ENTRANCED BY THE TRIUMPHANT GLORY OF THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED GERMAN EMPIRE
AND WERE PROFOUNDLY MOVED WHEN THEY SAW THE DREAM OF THEIR FATHERS
RESURGENT IN A MAGNIFICENT REALITY.

FOR--LET US MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT--THE TRUE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN REALIZED
FROM THIS TIME ONWARD, THAT KÃ¶NIGGRÃ¤TZ WAS THE TRAGIC, THOUGH NECESSARY,
PRE-CONDITION FOR THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EMPIRE WHICH SHOULD NO
LONGER BE BURDENED WITH THE PALSY OF THE OLD ALLIANCE AND WHICH INDEED
HAD NO SHARE IN THAT MORBID DECAY. ABOVE ALL, THE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN HAD
COME TO FEEL IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF HIS OWN BEING THAT THE HISTORICAL
MISSION OF THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG HAD COME TO AN END AND THAT THE NEW
EMPIRE COULD CHOOSE ONLY AN EMPEROR WHO WAS OF HEROIC MOULD AND WAS
THEREFORE WORTHY TO WEAR THE 'CROWN OF THE RHINE'. IT WAS RIGHT AND JUST
THAT DESTINY SHOULD BE PRAISED FOR HAVING CHOSEN A SCION OF THAT HOUSE
OF WHICH FREDERICK THE GREAT HAD IN PAST TIMES GIVEN THE NATION AN
ELEVATED AND RESPLENDENT SYMBOL FOR ALL TIME TO COME.

AFTER THE GREAT WAR OF 1870-71 THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG SET TO WORK WITH
ALL ITS DETERMINATION TO EXTERMINATE THE DANGEROUS GERMAN ELEMENT--ABOUT
WHOSE INNER FEELINGS AND ATTITUDE THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT--SLOWLY BUT
DELIBERATELY. I USE THE WORD EXTERMINATE, BECAUSE THAT ALONE EXPRESSES
WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE FINAL RESULT OF THE SLAVOPHILE POLICY. THEN IT
WAS THAT THE FIRE OF REBELLION BLAZED UP AMONG THE PEOPLE WHOSE
EXTERMINATION HAD BEEN DECREED. THAT FIRE WAS SUCH AS HAD NEVER BEEN
WITNESSED IN MODERN GERMAN HISTORY.

FOR THE FIRST TIME NATIONALISTS AND PATRIOTS WERE TRANSFORMED INTO
REBELS.

NOT REBELS AGAINST THE NATION OR THE STATE AS SUCH BUT REBELS AGAINST
THAT FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH THEY WERE CONVINCED, WOULD INEVITABLY
BRING ABOUT THE RUIN OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MODERN
HISTORY THE TRADITIONAL DYNASTIC PATRIOTISM AND NATIONAL LOVE OF
FATHERLAND AND PEOPLE WERE IN OPEN CONFLICT.

IT WAS TO THE MERIT OF THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT IN AUSTRIA DURING THE
CLOSING DECADE OF THE LAST CENTURY THAT IT POINTED OUT CLEARLY AND
UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT A STATE IS ENTITLED TO DEMAND RESPECT AND PROTECTION
FOR ITS AUTHORITY ONLY WHEN SUCH AUTHORITY IS ADMINISTERED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE INTERESTS OF THE NATION, OR AT LEAST NOT IN A MANNER
DETRIMENTAL TO THOSE INTERESTS.

THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE CAN NEVER BE AN END IN ITSELF; FOR, IF THAT
WERE SO, ANY KIND OF TYRANNY WOULD BE INVIOLABLE AND SACRED.

IF A GOVERNMENT USES THE INSTRUMENTS OF POWER IN ITS HANDS FOR THE
PURPOSE OF LEADING A PEOPLE TO RUIN, THEN REBELLION IS NOT ONLY THE
RIGHT BUT ALSO THE DUTY OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN.

THE QUESTION OF WHETHER AND WHEN SUCH A SITUATION EXISTS CANNOT BE
ANSWERED BY THEORETICAL DISSERTATIONS BUT ONLY BY THE EXERCISE OF FORCE,
AND IT IS SUCCESS THAT DECIDES THE ISSUE.

EVERY GOVERNMENT, EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE THE WORST POSSIBLE AND EVEN
THOUGH IT MAY HAVE BETRAYED THE NATION'S TRUST IN THOUSANDS OF WAYS,
WILL CLAIM THAT ITS DUTY IS TO UPHOLD THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE. ITS
ADVERSARIES, WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR NATIONAL SELF-PRESERVATION, MUST USE
THE SAME WEAPONS WHICH THE GOVERNMENT USES IF THEY ARE TO PREVAIL
AGAINST SUCH A RULE AND SECURE THEIR OWN FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE.
THEREFORE THE CONFLICT WILL BE FOUGHT OUT WITH 'LEGAL' MEANS AS LONG AS
THE POWER WHICH IS TO BE OVERTHROWN USES THEM; BUT THE INSURGENTS WILL
NOT HESITATE TO APPLY ILLEGAL MEANS IF THE OPPRESSOR HIMSELF EMPLOYS
THEM.

GENERALLY SPEAKING, WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT THE HIGHEST AIM OF HUMAN
EXISTENCE IS NOT THE MAINTENANCE OF A STATE OF GOVERNMENT BUT RATHER THE
CONSERVATION OF THE RACE.

IF THE RACE IS IN DANGER OF BEING OPPRESSED OR EVEN EXTERMINATED THE
QUESTION OF LEGALITY IS ONLY OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE. THE ESTABLISHED
POWER MAY IN SUCH A CASE EMPLOY ONLY THOSE MEANS WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED AS
'LEGAL'. YET THE INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION ON THE PART OF THE
OPPRESSED WILL ALWAYS JUSTIFY, TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE, THE EMPLOYMENT OF
ALL POSSIBLE RESOURCES.

ONLY ON THE RECOGNITION OF THIS PRINCIPLE WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR THOSE
STRUGGLES TO BE CARRIED THROUGH, OF WHICH HISTORY FURNISHES MAGNIFICENT
EXAMPLES IN ABUNDANCE, AGAINST FOREIGN BONDAGE OR OPPRESSION AT HOME.

HUMAN RIGHTS ARE ABOVE THE RIGHTS OF THE STATE. BUT IF A PEOPLE BE
DEFEATED IN THE STRUGGLE FOR ITS HUMAN RIGHTS THIS MEANS THAT ITS WEIGHT
HAS PROVED TOO LIGHT IN THE SCALE OF DESTINY TO HAVE THE LUCK OF BEING
ABLE TO ENDURE IN THIS TERRESTRIAL WORLD.

THE WORLD IS NOT THERE TO BE POSSESSED BY THE FAINT-HEARTED RACES.



AUSTRIA AFFORDS A VERY CLEAR AND STRIKING EXAMPLE OF HOW EASY IT IS FOR
TYRANNY TO HIDE ITS HEAD UNDER THE CLOAK OF WHAT IS CALLED 'LEGALITY'.

THE LEGAL EXERCISE OF POWER IN THE HABSBURG STATE WAS THEN BASED ON THE
ANTI-GERMAN ATTITUDE OF THE PARLIAMENT, WITH ITS NON-GERMAN MAJORITIES,
AND ON THE DYNASTIC HOUSE, WHICH WAS ALSO HOSTILE TO THE GERMAN ELEMENT.
THE WHOLE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE WAS INCORPORATED IN THESE TWO FACTORS.
TO ATTEMPT TO ALTER THE LOT OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT THROUGH THESE TWO
FACTORS WOULD HAVE BEEN SENSELESS. THOSE WHO ADVISED THE 'LEGAL' WAY AS
THE ONLY POSSIBLE WAY, AND ALSO OBEDIENCE TO THE STATE AUTHORITY, COULD
OFFER NO RESISTANCE; BECAUSE A POLICY OF RESISTANCE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN
PUT INTO EFFECT THROUGH LEGAL MEASURES. TO FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF THE
LEGALIST COUNSELLORS WOULD HAVE MEANT THE INEVITABLE RUIN OF THE GERMAN
ELEMENT WITHIN THE MONARCHY, AND THIS DISASTER WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN LONG
TO COME. THE GERMAN ELEMENT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN SAVED ONLY BECAUSE THE
STATE AS SUCH COLLAPSED.

THE SPECTACLED THEORIST WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS LIFE FOR HIS DOCTRINE
RATHER THAN FOR HIS PEOPLE.

BECAUSE MAN HAS MADE LAWS HE SUBSEQUENTLY COMES TO THINK THAT HE EXISTS
FOR THE SAKE OF THE LAWS.

A GREAT SERVICE RENDERED BY THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT THEN WAS THAT IT
ABOLISHED ALL SUCH NONSENSE, THOUGH THE DOCTRINAIRE THEORISTS AND OTHER
FETISH WORSHIPPERS WERE SHOCKED.

WHEN THE HABSBURGS ATTEMPTED TO COME TO CLOSE QUARTERS WITH THE GERMAN
ELEMENT, BY THE EMPLOYMENT OF ALL THE MEANS OF ATTACK WHICH THEY HAD AT
THEIR COMMAND, THE PAN-GERMAN PARTY HIT OUT RUTHLESSLY AGAINST THE
'ILLUSTRIOUS' DYNASTY. THIS PARTY WAS THE FIRST TO PROBE INTO AND EXPOSE
THE CORRUPT CONDITION OF THE STATE; AND IN DOING SO THEY OPENED THE EYES
OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. TO HAVE LIBERATED THE HIGH IDEAL OF LOVE FOR
ONE'S COUNTRY FROM THE EMBRACE OF THIS DEPLORABLE DYNASTY WAS ONE OF THE
GREAT SERVICES RENDERED BY THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT.

WHEN THAT PARTY FIRST MADE ITS APPEARANCE IT SECURED A LARGE
FOLLOWING--INDEED, THE MOVEMENT THREATENED TO BECOME ALMOST AN
AVALANCHE. BUT THE FIRST SUCCESSES WERE NOT MAINTAINED. AT THE TIME I
CAME TO VIENNA THE PAN-GERMAN PARTY HAD BEEN ECLIPSED BY THE
CHRISTIAN-SOCIALIST PARTY, WHICH HAD COME INTO POWER IN THE MEANTIME.
INDEED, THE PAN-GERMAN PARTY HAD SUNK TO A LEVEL OF ALMOST COMPLETE
INSIGNIFICANCE.

THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT ON THE ONE HAND AND THE
MARVELLOUS PROGRESS OF THE CHRISTIAN-SOCIALIST PARTY ON THE OTHER,
BECAME A CLASSIC OBJECT OF STUDY FOR ME, AND AS SUCH THEY PLAYED AN
IMPORTANT PART IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MY OWN VIEWS.

WHEN I CAME TO VIENNA ALL MY SYMPATHIES WERE EXCLUSIVELY WITH THE
PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT.

I WAS JUST AS MUCH IMPRESSED BY THE FACT THAT THEY HAD THE COURAGE TO
SHOUT HEIL HOHENZOLLERN AS I REJOICED AT THEIR DETERMINATION TO CONSIDER
THEMSELVES AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE, FROM WHICH THEY WERE
SEPARATED ONLY PROVISIONALLY. THEY NEVER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPLAIN THEIR ATTITUDE IN PUBLIC, WHICH RAISED MY ENTHUSIASM AND
CONFIDENCE. TO AVOW ONE'S PRINCIPLES PUBLICLY ON EVERY PROBLEM THAT
CONCERNED GERMANISM, AND NEVER TO MAKE ANY COMPROMISES, SEEMED TO ME THE
ONLY WAY OF SAVING OUR PEOPLE. WHAT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WAS HOW THIS
MOVEMENT BROKE DOWN SO SOON AFTER SUCH A MAGNIFICENT START; AND IT WAS
NO LESS INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT THE CHRISTIAN-SOCIALISTS SHOULD GAIN SUCH
TREMENDOUS POWER WITHIN SUCH A SHORT TIME. THEY HAD JUST REACHED THE
PINNACLE OF THEIR POPULARITY.

WHEN I BEGAN TO COMPARE THOSE TWO MOVEMENTS FATE PLACED BEFORE ME THE
BEST MEANS OF UNDERSTANDING THE CAUSES OF THIS PUZZLING PROBLEM. THE
ACTION OF FATE IN THIS CASE WAS HASTENED BY MY OWN STRAITENED
CIRCUMSTANCES.

I SHALL BEGIN MY ANALYSIS WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE TWO MEN WHO MUST BE
REGARDED AS THE FOUNDERS AND LEADERS OF THE TWO MOVEMENTS. THESE WERE
GEORGE VON SCHÃ¶NERER AND DR. KARL LUEGER.

AS FAR AS PERSONALITY GOES, BOTH WERE FAR ABOVE THE LEVEL AND STATURE OF
THE SO-CALLED PARLIAMENTARY FIGURES. THEY LIVED LIVES OF IMMACULATE AND
IRREPROACHABLE PROBITY AMIDST THE MIASMA OF ALL-ROUND POLITICAL
CORRUPTION. PERSONALLY I FIRST LIKED THE PAN-GERMAN REPRESENTATIVE,
SCHÃ¶NERER, AND IT WAS ONLY AFTERWARDS AND GRADUALLY THAT I FELT AN EQUAL
LIKING FOR THE CHRISTIAN-SOCIALIST LEADER.

WHEN I COMPARED THEIR RESPECTIVE ABILITIES SCHÃ¶NERER SEEMED TO ME A
BETTER AND MORE PROFOUND THINKER ON FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS. HE FORESAW THE
INEVITABLE DOWNFALL OF THE AUSTRIAN STATE MORE CLEARLY AND ACCURATELY
THAN ANYONE ELSE. IF THIS WARNING IN REGARD TO THE HABSBURG EMPIRE HAD
BEEN HEEDED IN GERMANY THE DISASTROUS WORLD WAR, WHICH INVOLVED GERMANY
AGAINST THE WHOLE OF EUROPE, WOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

BUT THOUGH SCHÃ¶NERER SUCCEEDED IN PENETRATING TO THE ESSENTIALS OF A
PROBLEM HE WAS VERY OFTEN MUCH MISTAKEN IN HIS JUDGMENT OF MEN.

AND HEREIN LAY DR. LUEGER'S SPECIAL TALENT. HE HAD A RARE GIFT OF
INSIGHT INTO HUMAN NATURE AND HE WAS VERY CAREFUL NOT TO TAKE MEN AS
SOMETHING BETTER THAN THEY WERE IN REALITY. HE BASED HIS PLANS ON THE
PRACTICAL POSSIBILITIES WHICH HUMAN LIFE OFFERED HIM, WHEREAS SCHÃ¶NERER
HAD ONLY LITTLE DISCRIMINATION IN THAT RESPECT. ALL IDEAS THAT THIS
PAN-GERMAN HAD WERE RIGHT IN THE ABSTRACT, BUT HE DID NOT HAVE THE
FORCEFULNESS OR UNDERSTANDING NECESSARY TO PUT HIS IDEAS ACROSS TO THE
BROAD MASSES. HE WAS NOT ABLE TO FORMULATE THEM SO THAT THEY COULD BE
EASILY GRASPED BY THE MASSES, WHOSE POWERS OF COMPREHENSION ARE LIMITED
AND WILL ALWAYS REMAIN SO. THEREFORE ALL SCHÃ¶NERER'S KNOWLEDGE WAS ONLY
THE WISDOM OF A PROPHET AND HE NEVER COULD SUCCEED IN HAVING IT PUT INTO
PRACTICE.

THIS LACK OF INSIGHT INTO HUMAN NATURE LED HIM TO FORM A WRONG ESTIMATE
OF THE FORCES BEHIND CERTAIN MOVEMENTS AND THE INHERENT STRENGTH OF OLD
INSTITUTIONS.

SCHÃ¶NERER INDEED REALIZED THAT THE PROBLEMS HE HAD TO DEAL WITH WERE IN
THE NATURE OF A WELTANSCHAUUNG; BUT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT ONLY THE
BROAD MASSES OF A NATION CAN MAKE SUCH CONVICTIONS PREVAIL, WHICH ARE
ALMOST OF A RELIGIOUS NATURE.

UNFORTUNATELY HE UNDERSTOOD ONLY VERY IMPERFECTLY HOW FEEBLE IS THE
FIGHTING SPIRIT OF THE SO-CALLED BOURGEOISIE. THAT WEAKNESS IS DUE TO
THEIR BUSINESS INTERESTS, WHICH INDIVIDUALS ARE TOO MUCH AFRAID OF
RISKING AND WHICH THEREFORE DETER THEM FROM TAKING ACTION. AND,
GENERALLY SPEAKING, A WELTANSCHAUUNG CAN HAVE NO PROSPECT OF SUCCESS
UNLESS THE BROAD MASSES DECLARE THEMSELVES READY TO ACT AS ITS
STANDARD-BEARERS AND TO FIGHT ON ITS BEHALF WHEREVER AND TO WHATEVER
EXTENT THAT MAY BE NECESSARY.

THIS FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LOWER STRATA OF THE
POPULATION RESULTED IN A VERY INADEQUATE CONCEPT OF THE SOCIAL PROBLEM.

IN ALL THIS DR. LUEGER WAS THE OPPOSITE OF SCHÃ¶NERER. HIS PROFOUND
KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE ENABLED HIM TO FORM A CORRECT ESTIMATE OF THE
VARIOUS SOCIAL FORCES AND IT SAVED HIM FROM UNDER-RATING THE POWER OF
EXISTING INSTITUTIONS. AND IT WAS PERHAPS THIS VERY QUALITY WHICH
ENABLED HIM TO UTILIZE THOSE INSTITUTIONS AS A MEANS TO SERVE THE
PURPOSES OF HIS POLICY.

HE SAW ONLY TOO CLEARLY THAT, IN OUR EPOCH, THE POLITICAL FIGHTING POWER
OF THE UPPER CLASSES IS QUITE INSIGNIFICANT AND NOT AT ALL CAPABLE OF
FIGHTING FOR A GREAT NEW MOVEMENT UNTIL THE TRIUMPH OF THAT MOVEMENT BE
SECURED. THUS HE DEVOTED THE GREATEST PART OF HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY TO
THE TASK OF WINNING OVER THOSE SECTIONS OF THE POPULATION WHOSE
EXISTENCE WAS IN DANGER AND FOSTERING THE MILITANT SPIRIT IN THEM RATHER
THAN ATTEMPTING TO PARALYSE IT. HE WAS ALSO QUICK TO ADOPT ALL AVAILABLE
MEANS FOR WINNING THE SUPPORT OF LONG-ESTABLISHED INSTITUTIONS, SO AS TO
BE ABLE TO DERIVE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE FOR HIS MOVEMENT FROM
THOSE OLD SOURCES OF POWER.

THUS IT WAS THAT, FIRST OF ALL, HE CHOSE AS THE SOCIAL BASIS OF HIS NEW
PARTY THAT MIDDLE CLASS WHICH WAS THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION. IN THIS
WAY HE SECURED A SOLID FOLLOWING WHICH WAS WILLING TO MAKE GREAT
SACRIFICES AND HAD GOOD FIGHTING STAMINA. HIS EXTREMELY WISE ATTITUDE
TOWARDS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH RAPIDLY WON OVER THE YOUNGER CLERGY IN SUCH
LARGE NUMBERS THAT THE OLD CLERICAL PARTY WAS FORCED TO RETIRE FROM THE
FIELD OF ACTION OR ELSE, WHICH WAS THE WISER COURSE, JOIN THE NEW PARTY,
IN THE HOPE OF GRADUALLY WINNING BACK ONE POSITION AFTER ANOTHER.

BUT IT WOULD BE A SERIOUS INJUSTICE TO THE MAN IF WE WERE TO REGARD THIS
AS HIS ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTIC. FOR HE POSSESSED THE QUALITIES OF AN
ABLE TACTICIAN, AND HAD THE TRUE GENIUS OF A GREAT REFORMER; BUT ALL
THESE WERE LIMITED BY HIS EXACT PERCEPTION OF THE POSSIBILITIES AT HAND
AND ALSO OF HIS OWN CAPABILITIES.

THE AIMS WHICH THIS REALLY EMINENT MAN DECIDED TO PURSUE WERE INTENSELY
PRACTICAL. HE WISHED TO CONQUER VIENNA, THE HEART OF THE MONARCHY. IT
WAS FROM VIENNA THAT THE LAST PULSES OF LIFE BEAT THROUGH THE DISEASED
AND WORN-OUT BODY OF THE DECREPIT EMPIRE. IF THE HEART COULD BE MADE
HEALTHIER THE OTHERS PARTS OF THE BODY WERE BOUND TO REVIVE. THAT IDEA
WAS CORRECT IN PRINCIPLE; BUT THE TIME WITHIN WHICH IT COULD BE APPLIED
IN PRACTICE WAS STRICTLY LIMITED. AND THAT WAS THE MAN'S WEAK POINT.

HIS ACHIEVEMENTS AS BURGOMASTER OF THE CITY OF VIENNA ARE IMMORTAL, IN
THE BEST SENSE OF THE WORD. BUT ALL THAT COULD NOT SAVE THE MONARCHY. IT
CAME TOO LATE.

HIS RIVAL, SCHÃ¶NERER, SAW THIS MORE CLEARLY. WHAT DR. LUEGER UNDERTOOK
TO PUT INTO PRACTICE TURNED OUT MARVELLOUSLY SUCCESSFUL. BUT THE RESULTS
WHICH HE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW THESE ACHIEVEMENTS DID NOT COME. SCHÃ¶NERER
DID NOT ATTAIN THE ENDS HE HAD PROPOSED TO HIMSELF; BUT HIS FEARS WERE
REALIZED, ALAS, IN A TERRIBLE FASHION. THUS BOTH THESE MEN FAILED TO
ATTAIN THEIR FURTHER OBJECTIVES. LUEGER COULD NOT SAVE AUSTRIA AND
SCHÃ¶NERER COULD NOT PREVENT THE DOWNFALL OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE IN
AUSTRIA.

TO STUDY THE CAUSES OF FAILURE IN THE CASE OF THESE TWO PARTIES IS TO
LEARN A LESSON THAT IS HIGHLY INSTRUCTIVE FOR OUR OWN EPOCH. THIS IS
SPECIALLY USEFUL FOR MY FRIENDS, BECAUSE IN MANY POINTS THE
CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR OWN DAY ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THAT TIME.
THEREFORE SUCH A LESSON MAY HELP US TO GUARD AGAINST THE MISTAKES WHICH
BROUGHT ONE OF THOSE MOVEMENTS TO AN END AND RENDERED THE OTHER BARREN
OF RESULTS.

IN MY OPINION, THE WRECK OF THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT IN AUSTRIA MUST BE
ATTRIBUTED TO THREE CAUSES.

THE FIRST OF THESE CONSISTED IN THE FACT THAT THE LEADERS DID NOT HAVE A
CLEAR CONCEPT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SOCIAL PROBLEM, PARTICULARLY FOR
A NEW MOVEMENT WHICH HAD AN ESSENTIALLY REVOLUTIONARY CHARACTER.
SCHÃ¶NERER AND HIS FOLLOWERS DIRECTED THEIR ATTENTION PRINCIPALLY TO THE
BOURGEOIS CLASSES. FOR THAT REASON THEIR MOVEMENT WAS BOUND TO TURN OUT
MEDIOCRE AND TAME. THE GERMAN BOURGEOISIE, ESPECIALLY IN ITS UPPER
CIRCLES, IS PACIFIST EVEN TO THE POINT OF COMPLETE
SELF-ABNEGATION--THOUGH THE INDIVIDUAL MAY NOT BE AWARE OF
THIS--WHEREVER THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THE NATION OR STATE ARE
CONCERNED. IN GOOD TIMES, WHICH IN THIS CASE MEANS TIMES OF GOOD
GOVERNMENT, SUCH A PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTITUDE MAKES THIS SOCIAL LAYER
EXTRAORDINARILY VALUABLE TO THE STATE. BUT WHEN THERE IS A BAD
GOVERNMENT, SUCH A QUALITY HAS A DESTRUCTIVE EFFECT. IN ORDER TO ASSURE
THE POSSIBILITY OF CARRYING THROUGH A REALLY STRENUOUS STRUGGLE, THE
PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT SHOULD HAVE DEVOTED ITS EFFORTS TO WINNING OVER THE
MASSES. THE FAILURE TO DO THIS LEFT THE MOVEMENT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
WITHOUT THE ELEMENTARY IMPULSE WHICH SUCH A WAVE NEEDS IF IT IS NOT TO
EBB WITHIN A SHORT WHILE.

IN FAILING TO SEE THE TRUTH OF THIS PRINCIPLE CLEARLY AT THE VERY OUTSET
OF THE MOVEMENT AND IN NEGLECTING TO PUT IT INTO PRACTICE THE NEW PARTY
MADE AN INITIAL MISTAKE WHICH COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE RECTIFIED
AFTERWARDS. FOR THE NUMEROUS MODERATE BOURGEOIS ELEMENTS ADMITTED INTO
THE MOVEMENTS INCREASINGLY DETERMINED ITS INTERNAL ORIENTATION AND THUS
FORESTALLED ALL FURTHER PROSPECTS OF GAINING ANY APPRECIABLE SUPPORT
AMONG THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE. UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS SUCH A MOVEMENT
COULD NOT GET BEYOND MERE DISCUSSION AND CRITICISM. QUASI-RELIGIOUS
FAITH AND THE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE WERE NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE MOVEMENT
ANY MORE. THEIR PLACE WAS TAKEN BY THE EFFORT TOWARDS 'POSITIVE'
COLLABORATION, WHICH IN THIS CASE MEANT THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE
EXISTING STATE OF AFFAIRS, GRADUALLY WHITTLING AWAY THE ROUGH CORNERS OF
THE QUESTIONS IN DISPUTE, AND ENDING UP WITH THE MAKING OF A
DISHONOURABLE PEACE.

SUCH WAS THE FATE OF THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT, BECAUSE AT THE START THE
LEADERS DID NOT REALIZE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT CONDITION OF SUCCESS WAS
THAT THEY SHOULD RECRUIT THEIR FOLLOWING FROM THE BROAD MASSES OF THE
PEOPLE. THE MOVEMENT THUS BECAME BOURGEOIS AND RESPECTABLE AND RADICAL
ONLY IN MODERATION.

FROM THIS FAILURE RESULTED THE SECOND CAUSE OF ITS RAPID DECLINE.

THE POSITION OF THE GERMANS IN AUSTRIA WAS ALREADY DESPERATE WHEN
PAN-GERMANISM AROSE. YEAR AFTER YEAR PARLIAMENT WAS BEING USED MORE AND
MORE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE GRADUAL EXTINCTION OF THE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN
POPULATION. THE ONLY HOPE FOR ANY ELEVENTH-HOUR EFFORT TO SAVE IT LAY IN
THE OVERTHROW OF THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM; BUT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE
PROSPECT OF THIS HAPPENING.

THEREWITH THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT WAS CONFRONTED WITH A QUESTION OF
PRIMARY IMPORTANCE.

TO OVERTHROW THE PARLIAMENT, SHOULD THE PAN-GERMANISTS HAVE ENTERED IT
'TO UNDERMINE IT FROM WITHIN', AS THE CURRENT PHRASE WAS? OR SHOULD THEY
HAVE ASSAILED THE INSTITUTION AS SUCH FROM THE OUTSIDE?

THEY ENTERED THE PARLIAMENT AND CAME OUT DEFEATED. BUT THEY HAD FOUND
THEMSELVES OBLIGED TO ENTER.

FOR IN ORDER TO WAGE AN EFFECTIVE WAR AGAINST SUCH A POWER FROM THE
OUTSIDE, INDOMITABLE COURAGE AND A READY SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE WERE
NECESSARY WEAPONS. IN SUCH CASES THE BULL MUST BE SEIZED BY THE HORNS.
FURIOUS DRIVES MAY BRING THE ASSAILANT TO THE GROUND AGAIN AND AGAIN;
BUT IF HE HAS A STOUT HEART HE WILL STAND UP, EVEN THOUGH SOME BONES MAY
BE BROKEN, AND ONLY AFTER A LONG AND TOUGH STRUGGLE WILL HE ACHIEVE HIS
TRIUMPH. NEW CHAMPIONS ARE ATTRACTED TO A CAUSE BY THE APPEAL OF GREAT
SACRIFICES MADE FOR ITS SAKE, UNTIL THAT INDOMITABLE SPIRIT IS FINALLY
CROWNED WITH SUCCESS.

FOR SUCH A RESULT, HOWEVER, THE CHILDREN OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE GREAT
MASSES ARE NECESSARY. THEY ALONE HAVE THE REQUISITE DETERMINATION AND
TENACITY TO FIGHT A SANGUINARY ISSUE THROUGH TO THE END. BUT THE
PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT DID NOT HAVE THESE BROAD MASSES AS ITS CHAMPIONS,
AND SO NO OTHER MEANS OF SOLUTION COULD BE TRIED OUT EXCEPT THAT OF
ENTERING PARLIAMCNT.

IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO THINK THAT THIS DECISION RESULTED FROM A LONG
SERIES OF INTERNAL HESITATIONS OF A MORAL KIND, OR THAT IT WAS THE
OUTCOME OF CAREFUL CALCULATION. NO. THEY DID NOT EVEN THINK OF ANOTHER
SOLUTION. THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THIS BLUNDER WERE ACTUATED BY
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS AND VAGUE NOTIONS AS TO WHAT WOULD BE THE
SIGNIFICANCE AND EFFECT OF TAKING PART IN SUCH A SPECIAL WAY IN THAT
INSTITUTION WHICH THEY HAD CONDEMNED ON PRINCIPLE. IN GENERAL THEY HOPED
THAT THEY WOULD THUS HAVE THE MEANS OF EXPOUNDING THEIR CAUSE TO THE
GREAT MASSES OF THE PEOPLE, BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEAK BEFORE
'THE FORUM OF THE WHOLE NATION'. ALSO, IT SEEMED REASONABLE TO BELIEVE
THAT BY ATTACKING THE EVIL IN THE ROOT THEY WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN
IF THE ATTACK CAME FROM OUTSIDE. THEY BELIEVED THAT, IF PROTECTED BY THE
IMMUNITY OF PARLIAMENT, THE POSITION OF THE INDIVIDUAL PROTAGONISTS
WOULD BE STRENGTHENED AND THAT THUS THE FORCE OF THEIR ATTACKS WOULD BE
ENHANCED.

IN REALITY EVERYTHING TURNED OUT QUITE OTHERWISE.

THE FORUM BEFORE WHICH THE PAN-GERMAN REPRESENTATIVES SPOKE HAD NOT
GROWN GREATER, BUT HAD ACTUALLY BECOME SMALLER; FOR EACH SPOKE ONLY TO
THE CIRCLE THAT WAS READY TO LISTEN TO HIM OR COULD READ THE REPORT OF
HIS SPEECH IN THE NEWSPAPERS.

BUT THE GREATER FORUM OF IMMEDIATE LISTENERS IS NOT THE PARLIAMENTARY
AUDITORIUM: IT IS THE LARGE PUBLIC MEETING. FOR HERE ALONE WILL THERE BE
THOUSANDS OF MEN WHO HAVE COME SIMPLY TO HEAR WHAT A SPEAKER HAS TO SAY,
WHEREAS IN THE PARLIAMENTARY SITTINGS ONLY A FEW HUNDRED ARE PRESENT;
AND FOR THE MOST PART THESE ARE THERE ONLY TO EARN THEIR DAILY ALLOWANCE
FOR ATTENDANCE AND NOT TO BE ENLIGHTENED BY THE WISDOM OF ONE OR OTHER
OF THE 'REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE'.

THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IS THAT THE SAME PUBLIC IS ALWAYS
PRESENT AND THAT THIS PUBLIC DOES NOT WISH TO LEARN ANYTHING NEW;
BECAUSE, SETTING ASIDE THE QUESTION OF ITS INTELLIGENCE, IT LACKS EVEN
THAT MODEST QUANTUM OF WILL-POWER WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE EFFORT OF
LEARNING.

NOT ONE OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE WILL PAY HOMAGE TO A
SUPERIOR TRUTH AND DEVOTE HIMSELF TO ITS SERVICE. NO. NOT ONE OF THESE
GENTRY WILL ACT THUS, EXCEPT HE HAS GROUNDS FOR HOPING THAT BY SUCH A
CONVERSION HE MAY BE ABLE TO RETAIN THE REPRESENTATION OF HIS
CONSTITUENCY IN THE COMING LEGISLATURE. THEREFORE, ONLY WHEN IT BECOMES
QUITE CLEAR THAT THE OLD PARTY IS LIKELY TO HAVE A BAD TIME OF IT AT THE
FORTHCOMING ELECTIONS--ONLY THEN WILL THOSE MODELS OF MANLY VIRTUE SET
OUT IN SEARCH OF A NEW PARTY OR A NEW POLICY WHICH MAY HAVE BETTER
ELECTORAL PROSPECTS; BUT OF COURSE THIS CHANGE OF POSITION WILL BE
ACCOMPANIED BY A VERITABLE DELUGE OF HIGH MORAL MOTIVES TO JUSTIFY IT.
AND THUS IT ALWAYS HAPPENS THAT WHEN AN EXISTING PARTY HAS INCURRED SUCH
GENERAL DISFAVOUR AMONG THE PUBLIC THAT IT IS THREATENED WITH THE
PROBABILITY OF A CRUSHING DEFEAT, THEN A GREAT MIGRATION COMMENCES. THE
PARLIAMENTARY RATS LEAVE THE PARTY SHIP.

ALL THIS HAPPENS NOT BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE CASE HAVE BECOME
BETTER INFORMED ON THE QUESTIONS AT ISSUE AND HAVE RESOLVED TO ACT
ACCORDINGLY. THESE CHANGES OF FRONT ARE EVIDENCE ONLY OF THAT GIFT OF
CLAIRVOYANCE WHICH WARNS THE PARLIAMENTARY FLEA AT THE RIGHT MOMENT AND
ENABLES HIM TO HOP INTO ANOTHER WARM PARTY BED.

TO SPEAK BEFORE SUCH A FORUM SIGNIFIES CASTING PEARLS BEFORE CERTAIN
ANIMALS.

VERILY IT DOES NOT REPAY THE PAINS TAKEN; FOR THE RESULT MUST ALWAYS BE
NEGATIVE.

AND THAT IS ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED. THE PAN-GERMAN REPRESENTATIVES MIGHT
HAVE TALKED THEMSELVES HOARSE, BUT TO NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER.

THE PRESS EITHER IGNORED THEM TOTALLY OR SO MUTILATED THEIR SPEECHES
THAT THE LOGICAL CONSISTENCY WAS DESTROYED OR THE MEANING TWISTED ROUND
IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE PUBLIC GOT ONLY A VERY WRONG IMPRESSION REGARDING
THE AIMS OF THE NEW MOVEMENT. WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS SAID WAS NOT
OF IMPORTANCE. THE IMPORTANT MATTER WAS WHAT PEOPLE READ AS COMING FROM
THEM. THIS CONSISTED OF MERE EXTRACTS WHICH HAD BEEN TORN OUT OF THE
CONTEXT OF THE SPEECHES AND GAVE AN IMPRESSION OF INCOHERENT NONSENSE,
WHICH INDEED WAS PURPOSELY MEANT. THUS THE ONLY PUBLIC BEFORE WHICH THEY
REALLY SPOKE CONSISTED MERELY OF FIVE HUNDRED PARLIAMENTARIANS; AND THAT
SAYS ENOUGH.

THE WORST WAS THE FOLLOWING:

THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT COULD HOPE FOR SUCCESS ONLY IF THE LEADERS
REALIZED FROM THE VERY FIRST MOMENT THAT HERE THERE WAS NO QUESTION SO
MUCH OF A NEW PARTY AS OF A NEW WELTANSCHAUUNG. THIS ALONE COULD AROUSE
THE INNER MORAL FORCES THAT WERE NECESSARY FOR SUCH A GIGANTIC STRUGGLE.
AND FOR THIS STRUGGLE THE LEADERS MUST BE MEN OF FIRST-CLASS BRAINS AND
INDOMITABLE COURAGE. IF THE STRUGGLE ON BEHALF OF A WELTANSCHAUUNG IS
NOT CONDUCTED BY MEN OF HEROIC SPIRIT WHO ARE READY TO SACRIFICE,
EVERYTHING, WITHIN A SHORT WHILE IT WILL BECOME IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND REAL
FIGHTING FOLLOWERS WHO ARE READY TO LAY DOWN THEIR LIVES FOR THE CAUSE.
A MAN WHO FIGHTS ONLY FOR HIS OWN EXISTENCE HAS NOT MUCH LEFT OVER FOR
THE SERVICE OF THE COMMUNITY.

IN ORDER TO SECURE THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS,
EVERYBODY CONCERNED MUST BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEW MOVEMENT
LOOKS TO POSTERITY FOR ITS HONOUR AND GLORY BUT THAT IT HAS NO
RECOMPENSE TO OFFER TO THE PRESENT-DAY MEMBERS. IF A MOVEMENT SHOULD
OFFER A LARGE NUMBER OF POSITIONS AND OFFICES THAT ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE
THE NUMBER OF UNWORTHY CANDIDATES ADMITTED TO MEMBERSHIP WILL BE
CONSTANTLY ON THE INCREASE AND EVENTUALLY A DAY WILL COME WHEN THERE
WILL BE SUCH A PREPONDERANCE OF POLITICAL PROFITEERS AMONG THE
MEMBERSHIP OF A SUCCESSFUL PARTY THAT THE COMBATANTS WHO BORE THE BRUNT
OF THE BATTLE IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF THE MOVEMENT CAN NOW SCARCELY
RECOGNIZE THEIR OWN PARTY AND MAY BE EJECTED BY THE LATER ARRIVALS AS
UNWANTED BALLAST. THEREWITH THE MOVEMENT WILL NO LONGER HAVE A MISSION
TO FULFIL.

ONCE THE PAN-GERMANISTS DECIDED TO COLLABORATE WITH PARLIAMENT THEY WERE
NO LONGER LEADERS AND COMBATANTS IN A POPULAR MOVEMENT, BUT MERELY
PARLIAMENTARIANS. THUS THE MOVEMENT SANK TO THE COMMON POLITICAL PARTY
LEVEL OF THE DAY AND NO LONGER HAD THE STRENGTH TO FACE A HOSTILE FATE
AND DEFY THE RISK OF MARTYRDOM. INSTEAD OF FIGHTING, THE PAN-GERMAN
LEADERS FELL INTO THE HABIT OF TALKING AND NEGOTIATING. THE NEW
PARLIAMENTARIANS SOON FOUND THAT IT WAS A MORE SATISFACTORY, BECAUSE
LESS RISKY, WAY OF FULFILLING THEIR TASK IF THEY WOULD DEFEND THE NEW
WELTANSCHAUUNG WITH THE SPIRITUAL WEAPON OF PARLIAMENTARY RHETORIC
RATHER THAN TAKE UP A FIGHT IN WHICH THEY PLACED THEIR LIVES IN DANGER,
THE OUTCOME OF WHICH ALSO WAS UNCERTAIN AND EVEN AT THE BEST COULD OFFER
NO PROSPECT OF PERSONAL GAIN FOR THEMSELVES.

WHEN THEY HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS IN PARLIAMENT THEIR ADHERENTS OUTSIDE
HOPED AND WAITED FOR MIRACLES TO HAPPEN. NATURALLY NO SUCH MIRACLES
HAPPENED OR COULD HAPPEN. WHEREUPON THE ADHERENTS OF THE MOVEMENT SOON
GREW IMPATIENT, BECAUSE REPORTS THEY READ ABOUT THEIR OWN DEPUTIES DID
NOT IN THE LEAST COME UP TO WHAT HAD BEEN EXPECTED WHEN THEY VOTED FOR
THESE DEPUTIES AT THE ELECTIONS. THE REASON FOR THIS WAS NOT FAR TO
SEEK. IT WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT AN UNFRIENDLY PRESS REFRAINED FROM
GIVING A TRUE ACCOUNT OF WHAT THE PAN-GERMAN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE
PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY DOING.

ACCORDING AS THE NEW DEPUTIES GOT TO LIKE THIS MILD FORM OF
'REVOLUTIONARY' STRUGGLE IN PARLIAMENT AND IN THE PROVINCIAL DIETS THEY
GRADUALLY BECAME RELUCTANT TO RESUME THE MORE HAZARDOUS WORK OF
EXPOUNDING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE MOVEMENT BEFORE THE BROAD MASSES OF THE
PEOPLE.

MASS MEETINGS IN PUBLIC BECAME MORE AND MORE RARE, THOUGH THESE ARE THE
ONLY MEANS OF EXERCISING A REALLY EFFECTIVE INFLUENCE ON THE PEOPLE;
BECAUSE HERE THE INFLUENCE COMES FROM DIRECT PERSONAL CONTACT AND IN
THIS WAY THE SUPPORT OF LARGE SECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE CAN BE OBTAINED.

WHEN THE TABLES ON WHICH THE SPEAKERS USED TO STAND IN THE GREAT
BEER-HALLS, ADDRESSING AN ASSEMBLY OF THOUSANDS, WERE DESERTED FOR THE
PARLIAMENTARY TRIBUNE AND THE SPEECHES WERE NO LONGER ADDRESSED TO THE
PEOPLE DIRECTLY BUT TO THE SO-CALLED 'CHOSEN' REPRESENTATIVES, THE
PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT LOST ITS POPULAR CHARACTER AND IN A LITTLE WHILE
DEGENERATED TO THE LEVEL OF A MORE OR LESS SERIOUS CLUB WHERE PROBLEMS
OF THE DAY ARE DISCUSSED ACADEMICALLY.

THE WRONG IMPRESSION CREATED BY THE PRESS WAS NO LONGER CORRECTED BY
PERSONAL CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE THROUGH PUBLIC MEETINGS, WHEREBY THE
INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTATIVES MIGHT HAVE GIVEN A TRUE ACCOUNT OF THEIR
ACTIVITIES. THE FINAL RESULT OF THIS NEGLECT WAS THAT THE WORD
'PAN-GERMAN' CAME TO HAVE AN UNPLEASANT SOUND IN THE EARS OF THE MASSES.

THE KNIGHTS OF THE PEN AND THE LITERARY SNOBS OF TO-DAY SHOULD BE MADE
TO REALIZE THAT THE GREAT TRANSFORMATIONS WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THIS
WORLD WERE NEVER CONDUCTED BY A GOOSEQUILL. NO. THE TASK OF THE PEN MUST
ALWAYS BE THAT OF PRESENTING THE THEORETICAL CONCEPTS WHICH MOTIVATE
SUCH CHANGES. THE FORCE WHICH HAS EVER AND ALWAYS SET IN MOTION GREAT
HISTORICAL AVALANCHES OF RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IS THE MAGIC
POWER OF THE SPOKEN WORD.

THE BROAD MASSES OF A POPULATION ARE MORE AMENABLE TO THE APPEAL OF
RHETORIC THAN TO ANY OTHER FORCE. ALL GREAT MOVEMENTS ARE POPULAR
MOVEMENTS. THEY ARE THE VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS OF HUMAN PASSIONS AND
EMOTIONS, STIRRED INTO ACTIVITY BY THE RUTHLESS GODDESS OF DISTRESS OR
BY THE TORCH OF THE SPOKEN WORD CAST INTO THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLE. IN NO
CASE HAVE GREAT MOVEMENTS BEEN SET AFOOT BY THE SYRUPY EFFUSIONS OF
AESTHETIC LITTÃ©RATEURS AND DRAWING-ROOM HEROES.

THE DOOM OF A NATION CAN BE AVERTED ONLY BY A STORM OF GLOWING PASSION;
BUT ONLY THOSE WHO ARE PASSIONATE THEMSELVES CAN AROUSE PASSION IN
OTHERS. IT IS ONLY THROUGH THE CAPACITY FOR PASSIONATE FEELING THAT
CHOSEN LEADERS CAN WIELD THE POWER OF THE WORD WHICH, LIKE HAMMER BLOWS,
WILL OPEN THE DOOR TO THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE.

HE WHO IS NOT CAPABLE OF PASSIONATE FEELING AND SPEECH WAS NEVER CHOSEN
BY PROVIDENCE TO BE THE HERALD OF ITS WILL. THEREFORE A WRITER SHOULD
STICK TO HIS INK-BOTTLE AND BUSY HIMSELF WITH THEORETICAL QUESTIONS IF
HE HAS THE REQUISITE ABILITY AND KNOWLEDGE. HE HAS NOT BEEN BORN OR
CHOSEN TO BE A LEADER.

A MOVEMENT WHICH HAS GREAT ENDS TO ACHIEVE MUST CAREFULLY GUARD AGAINST
THE DANGER OF LOSING CONTACT WITH THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE. EVERY
PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED MUST BE EXAMINED FROM THIS VIEWPOINT FIRST OF ALL
AND THE DECISION TO BE MADE MUST ALWAYS BE IN HARMONY WITH THIS
PRINCIPLE.

THE MOVEMENT MUST AVOID EVERYTHING WHICH MIGHT LESSEN OR WEAKONE CAN IMAGINE WHAT KIND OF THOUGHTS SUCH A PROSPECT AWAKENED IN THE
MIND OF A YOUNG FELLOW WHO WAS BY NO MEANS WHAT IS CALLED A 'GOOD BOY'
IN THE CURRENT SENSE OF THAT TERM. THE RIDICULOUSLY EASY SCHOOL TASKS
WHICH WE WERE GIVEN MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO SPEND FAR MORE TIME IN
THE OPEN AIR THAN AT HOME. TO-DAY, WHEN MY POLITICAL OPPONENTS PRY INTO
MY LIFE WITH DILIGENT SCRUTINY, AS FAR BACK AS THE DAYS OF MY BOYHOOD,
SO AS FINALLY TO BE ABLE TO PROVE WHAT DISREPUTABLE TRICKS THIS HITLER
WAS ACCUSTOMED TO IN HIS YOUNG DAYS, I THANK HEAVEN THAT I CAN LOOK BACK
TO THOSE HAPPY DAYS AND FIND THE MEMORY OF THEM HELPFUL. THE FIELDS AND
THE WOODS WERE THEN THE TERRAIN ON WHICH ALL DISPUTES WERE FOUGHT OUT.

EVEN ATTENDANCE AT THE REALSCHULE COULD NOT ALTER MY WAY OF SPENDING MY
TIME. BUT I HAD NOW ANOTHER BATTLE TO FIGHT.

SO LONG AS THE PATERNAL PLAN TO MAKE A STATE FUNCTIONARY CONTRADICTED MY
OWN INCLINATIONS ONLY IN THE ABSTRACT, THE CONFLICT WAS EASY TO BEAR. I
COULD BE DISCREET ABOUT EXPRESSING MY PERSONAL VIEWS AND THUS AVOID
CONSTANTLY RECURRENT DISPUTES. MY OWN RESOLUTION NOT TO BECOME A
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE TIME BEING TO PUT MY MIND
COMPLETELY AT REST. I HELD ON TO THAT RESOLUTION INEXORABLY. BUT THE
SITUATION BECAME MORE DIFFICULT ONCE I HAD A POSITIVE PLAN OF MY OWN
WHICH I MIGHT PRESENT TO MY FATHER AS A COUNTER-SUGGESTION. THIS
HAPPENED WHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD. HOW IT CAME ABOUT I CANNOT EXACTLY
SAY NOW; BUT ONE DAY IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT I WOULD BE A PAINTER--I
MEAN AN ARTIST. THAT I HAD AN APTITUDE FOR DRAWING WAS AN ADMITTED FACT.
IT WAS EVEN ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MY FATHER HAD SENT ME TO THE
REALSCHULE; BUT HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF HAVING THAT TALENT DEVELOPED IN
SUCH A WAY THAT I COULD TAKE UP PAINTING AS A PROFESSIONAL CAREER. QUITE
THE CONTRARY. WHEN, AS A RESULT OF MY RENEWED REFUSAL TO ADOPT HIS
FAVOURITE PLAN, MY FATHER ASKED ME FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT I MYSELF
REALLY WISHED TO BE, THE RESOLUTION THAT I HAD ALREADY FORMED EXPRESSED
ITSELF ALMOST AUTOMATICALLY. FOR A WHILE MY FATHER WAS SPEECHLESS. "A
PAINTER? AN ARTIST-PAINTER?" HE EXCLAIMED.

HE WONDERED WHETHER I WAS IN A SOUND STATE OF MIND. HE THOUGHT THAT HE
MIGHT NOT HAVE CAUGHT MY WORDS RIGHTLY, OR THAT HE HAD MISUNDERSTOOD
WHAT I MEANT. BUT WHEN I HAD EXPLAINED MY IDEAS TO HIM AND HE SAW HOW
SERIOUSLY I TOOK THEM, HE OPPOSED THEM WITH THAT FULL DETERMINATION
WHICH WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM. HIS DECISION WAS EXCEEDINGLY SIMPLE AND
COULD NOT BE DEFLECTED FROM ITS COURSE BY ANY CONSIDERATION OF WHAT MY
OWN NATURAL QUALIFICATIONS REALLY WERE.

"ARTIST! NOT AS LONG AS I LIVE, NEVER." AS THE SON HAD INHERITED SOME OF
THE FATHER'S OBSTINACY, BESIDES HAVING OTHER QUALITIES OF HIS OWN, MY
REPLY WAS EQUALLY ENERGETIC. BUT IT STATED SOMETHING QUITE THE CONTRARY.

AT THAT OUR STRUGGLE BECAME STALEMATE. THE FATHER WOULD NOT ABANDON HIS
'NEVER', AND I BECAME ALL THE MORE CONSOLIDATED IN MY 'NEVERTHELESS'.

NATURALLY THE RESULTING SITUATION WAS NOT PLEASANT. THE OLD GENTLEMAN
WAS BITTERLY ANNOYED; AND INDEED SO WAS I, ALTHOUGH I REALLY LOVED HIM.
MY FATHER FORBADE ME TO ENTERTAIN ANY HOPES OF TAKING UP THE ART OF
PAINTING AS A PROFESSION. I WENT A STEP FURTHER AND DECLARED THAT I
WOULD NOT STUDY ANYTHING ELSE. WITH SUCH DECLARATIONS THE SITUATION
BECAME STILL MORE STRAINED, SO THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN IRREVOCABLY
DECIDED TO ASSERT HIS PARENTAL AUTHORITY AT ALL COSTS. THAT LED ME TO
ADOPT AN ATTITUDE OF CIRCUMSPECT SILENCE, BUT I PUT MY THREAT INTO
EXECUTION. I THOUGHT THAT, ONCE IT BECAME CLEAR TO MY FATHER THAT I WAS
MAKING NO PROGRESS AT THE REALSCHULE, FOR WEAL OR FOR WOE, HE WOULD BE
FORCED TO ALLOW ME TO FOLLOW THE HAPPY CAREER I HAD DREAMED OF.

I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I CALCULATED RIGHTLY OR NOT. CERTAINLY MY FAILURE
TO MAKE PROGRESS BECAME QUITE VISIBLE IN THE SCHOOL. I STUDIED JUST THE
SUBJECTS THAT APPEALED TO ME, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH I THOUGHT MIGHT BE
OF ADVANTAGE TO ME LATER ON AS A PAINTER. WHAT DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE
ANY IMPORTANCE FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW, OR WHAT DID NOT OTHERWISE APPEAL
TO ME FAVOURABLY, I COMPLETELY SABOTAGED. MY SCHOOL REPORTS OF THAT TIME
WERE ALWAYS IN THE EXTREMES OF GOOD OR BAD, ACCORDING TO THE SUBJECT AND
THE INTEREST IT HAD FOR ME. IN ONE COLUMN MY QUALIFICATION READ 'VERY
GOOD' OR 'EXCELLENT'. IN ANOTHER IT READ 'AVERAGE' OR EVEN 'BELOW
AVERAGE'. BY FAR MY BEST SUBJECTS WERE GEOGRAPHY AND, EVEN MORE SO,
GENERAL HISTORY. THESE WERE MY TWO FAVOURITE SUBJECTS, AND I LED THE
CLASS IN THEM.

WHEN I LOOK BACK OVER SO MANY YEARS AND TRY TO JUDGE THE RESULTS OF THAT
EXPERIENCE I FIND TWO VERY SIGNIFICANT FACTS STANDING OUT CLEARLY BEFORE
MY MIND.

FIRST, I BECAME A NATIONALIST.

SECOND, I LEARNED TO UNDERSTAND AND GRASP THE TRUE MEANING OF HISTORY.

THE OLD AUSTRIA WAS A MULTI-NATIONAL STATE. IN THOSE DAYS AT LEAST THE
CITIZENS OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE, TAKEN THROUGH AND THROUGH, COULD NOT
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT FACT MEANT IN THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF THE INDIVIDUALS
WITHIN SUCH A STATE. AFTER THE MAGNIFICENT TRIUMPHANT MARCH OF THE
VICTORIOUS ARMIES IN THE FRANCO-GERMAN WAR THE GERMANS IN THE REICH
BECAME STEADILY MORE AND MORE ESTRANGED FROM THE GERMANS BEYOND THEIR
FRONTIERS, PARTLY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT DEIGN TO APPRECIATE THOSE OTHER
GERMANS AT THEIR TRUE VALUE OR SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE INCAPABLE OF
DOING SO.

THE GERMANS OF THE REICH DID NOT REALIZE THAT IF THE GERMANS IN AUSTRIA
HAD NOT BEEN OF THE BEST RACIAL STOCK THEY COULD NEVER HAVE GIVEN THE
STAMP OF THEIR OWN CHARACTER TO AN EMPIRE OF 52 MILLIONS, SO DEFINITELY
THAT IN GERMANY ITSELF THE IDEA AROSE--THOUGH QUITE AN ERRONEOUS
ONE--THAT AUSTRIA WAS A GERMAN STATE. THAT WAS AN ERROR WHICH LED TO
DIRE CONSEQUENCES; BUT ALL THE SAME IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT TESTIMONY TO
THE CHARACTER OF THE TEN MILLION GERMANS IN THAT EAST MARK. (NOTE 3)
ONLY VERY FEW OF THE GERMANS IN THE REICH ITSELF HAD AN IDEA OF THE BITTER
STRUGGLE WHICH THOSE EASTERN GERMANS HAD TO CARRY ON DAILY FOR THE
PRESERVATION OF THEIR GERMAN LANGUAGE, THEIR GERMAN SCHOOLS AND THEIR
GERMAN CHARACTER. ONLY TO-DAY, WHEN A TRAGIC FATE HAS TORN SEVERAL
MILLIONS OF OUR KINSFOLK AWAY FROM THE REICH AND HAS FORCED THEM TO LIVE
UNDER THE RULE OF THE STRANGER, DREAMING OF THAT COMMON FATHERLAND
TOWARDS WHICH ALL THEIR YEARNINGS ARE DIRECTED AND STRUGGLING TO UPHOLD
AT LEAST THE SACRED RIGHT OF USING THEIR MOTHER TONGUE--ONLY NOW HAVE
THE WIDER CIRCLES OF THE GERMAN POPULATION COME TO REALIZE WHAT IT MEANS
TO HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THE TRADITIONS OF ONE'S RACE. AND SO AT LAST
PERHAPS THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE AND THERE WHO CAN ASSESS THE GREATNESS OF
THAT GERMAN SPIRIT WHICH ANIMATED THE OLD EAST MARK AND ENABLED THOSE
PEOPLE, LEFT ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THEIR OWN RESOURCES, TO DEFEND THE
EMPIRE AGAINST THE ORIENT FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO HOLD
FAST THE FRONTIERS OF THE GERMAN LANGUAGE THROUGH A GUERILLA WARFARE OF
ATTRITION, AT A TIME WHEN THE GERMAN EMPIRE WAS SEDULOUSLY CULTIVATING
AN INTEREST FOR COLONIES BUT NOT FOR ITS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD BEFORE THE
THRESHOLD OF ITS OWN DOOR.

[NOTE 3. SEE TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION.]

WHAT HAS HAPPENED ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE, IN EVERY KIND OF STRUGGLE,
HAPPENED ALSO IN THE LANGUAGE FIGHT WHICH WAS CARRIED ON IN THE OLD
AUSTRIA. THERE WERE THREE GROUPS--THE FIGHTERS, THE HEDGERS AND THE
TRAITORS. EVEN IN THE SCHOOLS THIS SIFTING ALREADY BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE.
AND IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE STRUGGLE FOR THE LANGUAGE WAS WAGED
PERHAPS IN ITS BITTEREST FORM AROUND THE SCHOOL; BECAUSE THIS WAS THE
NURSERY WHERE THE SEEDS HAD TO BE WATERED WHICH WERE TO SPRING UP AND
FORM THE FUTURE GENERATION. THE TACTICAL OBJECTIVE OF THE FIGHT WAS THE
WINNING OVER OF THE CHILD, AND IT WAS TO THE CHILD THAT THE FIRST
RALLYING CRY WAS ADDRESSED:

"GERMAN YOUTH, DO NOT FORGET THAT YOU ARE A GERMAN," AND "REMEMBER,
LITTLE GIRL, THAT ONE DAY YOU MUST BE A GERMAN MOTHER."

THOSE WHO KNOW SOMETHING OF THE JUVENILE SPIRIT CAN UNDERSTAND HOW YOUTH
WILL ALWAYS LEND A GLAD EAR TO SUCH A RALLYING CRY. UNDER MANY FORMS THE
YOUNG PEOPLE LED THE STRUGGLE, FIGHTING IN THEIR OWN WAY AND WITH THEIR
OWN WEAPONS. THEY REFUSED TO SING NON-GERMAN SONGS. THE GREATER THE
EFFORTS MADE TO WIN THEM AWAY FROM THEIR GERMAN ALLEGIANCE, THE MORE
THEY EXALTED THE GLORY OF THEIR GERMAN HEROES. THEY STINTED THEMSELVES
IN BUYING THINGS TO EAT, SO THAT THEY MIGHT SPARE THEIR PENNIES TO HELP
THE WAR CHEST OF THEIR ELDERS. THEY WERE INCREDIBLY ALERT IN THE
SIGNIFICANCE OF WHAT THE NON-GERMAN TEACHERS SAID AND THEY CONTRADICTED
IN UNISON. THEY WORE THE FORBIDDEN EMBLEMS OF THEIR OWN KINSFOLK AND
WERE HAPPY WHEN PENALISED FOR DOING SO, OR EVEN PHYSICALLY PUNISHED. IN
MINIATURE THEY WERE MIRRORS OF LOYALTY FROM WHICH THE OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT
LEARN A LESSON.

AND THUS IT WAS THAT AT A COMPARATIVELY EARLY AGE I TOOK PART IN THE
STRUGGLE WHICH THE NATIONALITIES WERE WAGING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN THE
OLD AUSTRIA. WHEN MEETINGS WERE HELD FOR THE SOUTH MARK GERMAN LEAGUE
AND THE SCHOOL LEAGUE WE WORE CORNFLOWERS AND BLACK-RED-GOLD COLOURS TO
EXPRESS OUR LOYALTY. WE GREETED ONE ANOTHER WITH HEIL! AND INSTEAD OF
THE AUSTRIAN ANTHEM WE SANG OUR OWN DEUTSCHLAND ÃœBER ALLES, DESPITE
WARNINGS AND PENALTIES. THUS THE YOUTH WERE EDUCATED POLITICALLY AT A
TIME WHEN THE CITIZENS OF A SO-CALLED NATIONAL STATE FOR THE MOST PART
KNEW LITTLE OF THEIR OWN NATIONALITY EXCEPT THE LANGUAGE. OF COURSE, I
DID NOT BELONG TO THE HEDGERS. WITHIN A LITTLE WHILE I HAD BECOME AN
ARDENT 'GERMAN NATIONAL', WHICH HAS A DIFFERENT MEANING FROM THE PARTY
SIGNIFICANCE ATTACHED TO THAT PHRASE TO-DAY.

I DEVELOPED VERY RAPIDLY IN THE NATIONALIST DIRECTION, AND BY THE TIME I
WAS 15 YEARS OLD I HAD COME TO UNDERSTAND THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN
DYNASTIC PATRIOTISM AND NATIONALISM BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF FOLK, OR
PEOPLE, MY INCLINATION BEING ENTIRELY IN FAVOUR OF THE LATTER.

SUCH A PREFERENCE MAY NOT PERHAPS BE CLEARLY INTELLIGIBLE TO THOSE WHO
HAVE NEVER TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO STUDY THE INTERNAL CONDITIONS THAT
PREVAILED UNDER THE HABSBURG MONARCHY.

AMONG HISTORICAL STUDIES UNIVERSAL HISTORY WAS THE SUBJECT ALMOST
EXCLUSIVELY TAUGHT IN THE AUSTRIAN SCHOOLS, FOR OF SPECIFIC AUSTRIAN
HISTORY THERE WAS ONLY VERY LITTLE. THE FATE OF THIS STATE WAS CLOSELY
BOUND UP WITH THE EXISTENCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF GERMANY AS A WHOLE; SO A
DIVISION OF HISTORY INTO GERMAN HISTORY AND AUSTRIAN HISTORY WOULD BE
PRACTICALLY INCONCEIVABLE. AND INDEED IT WAS ONLY WHEN THE GERMAN PEOPLE
CAME TO BE DIVIDED BETWEEN TWO STATES THAT THIS DIVISION OF GERMAN
HISTORY BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE.

THE INSIGNIA (NOTE 4) OF A FORMER IMPERIAL SOVEREIGNTY WHICH WERE STILL
PRESERVED IN VIENNA APPEARED TO ACT AS MAGICAL RELICS RATHER THAN AS THE
VISIBLE GUARANTEE OF AN EVERLASTING BOND OF UNION.

[NOTE 4. WHEN FRANCIS II HAD LAID DOWN HIS TITLE AS EMPEROR OF THE HOLY
ROMAN EMPIREOF THE GERMAN NATION, WHICH HE DID AT THE COMMAND OF NAPOLEON,
THE CROWNAND MACE, AS THE IMPERIAL INSIGNIA, WERE KEPT IN VIENNA. AFTER
THE GERMAN EMPIRE WAS REFOUNDED, IN 1871, UNDER WILLIAM I, THERE WERE MANY
DEMANDS TOHAVE THE INSIGNIA TRANSFERRED TO BERLIN. BUT THESE WENT
UNHEEDED. HITLER HAD THEM BROUGHT TO GERMANY AFTER THE AUSTRIAN ANSCHLUSS
AND DISPLAYED AT NUREMBERG DURING THE PARTY CONGRESS IN SEPTEMBER 1938.]

WHEN THE HABSBURG STATE CRUMBLED TO PIECES IN 1918 THE AUSTRIAN GERMANS
INSTINCTIVELY RAISED AN OUTCRY FOR UNION WITH THEIR GERMAN FATHERLAND.
THAT WAS THE VOICE OF A UNANIMOUS YEARNING IN THE HEARTS OF THE WHOLE
PEOPLE FOR A RETURN TO THE UNFORGOTTEN HOME OF THEIR FATHERS. BUT SUCH A
GENERAL YEARNING COULD NOT BE EXPLAINED EXCEPT BY ATTRIBUTING THE CAUSE
OF IT TO THE HISTORICAL TRAINING THROUGH WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL AUSTRIAN
GERMANS HAD PASSED. THEREIN LAY A SPRING THAT NEVER DRIED UP. ESPECIALLY
IN TIMES OF DISTRACTION AND FORGETFULNESS ITS QUIET VOICE WAS A REMINDER
OF THE PAST, BIDDING THE PEOPLE TO LOOK OUT BEYOND THE MERE WELFARE OF
THE MOMENT TO A NEW FUTURE.

THE TEACHING OF UNIVERSAL HISTORY IN WHAT ARE CALLED THE MIDDLE SCHOOLS
IS STILL VERY UNSATISFACTORY. FEW TEACHERS REALIZE THAT THE PURPOSE OF
TEACHING HISTORY IS NOT THE MEMORIZING OF SOME DATES AND FACTS, THAT THE
STUDENT IS NOT INTERESTED IN KNOWING THE EXACT DATE OF A BATTLE OR THE
BIRTHDAY OF SOME MARSHAL OR OTHER, AND NOT AT ALL--OR AT LEAST ONLY VERY
INSIGNIFICANTLY--INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHEN THE CROWN OF HIS FATHERS WAS
PLACED ON THE BROW OF SOME MONARCH. THESE ARE CERTAINLY NOT LOOKED UPON
AS IMPORTANT MATTERS.

TO STUDY HISTORY MEANS TO SEARCH FOR AND DISCOVER THE FORCES THAT ARE
THE CAUSES OF THOSE RESULTS WHICH APPEAR BEFORE OUR EYES AS HISTORICAL
EVENTS. THE ART OF READING AND STUDYING CONSISTS IN REMEMBERING THE
ESSENTIALS AND FORGETTING WHAT IS NOT ESSENTIAL.

PROBABLY MY WHOLE FUTURE LIFE WAS DETERMINED BY THE FACT THAT I HAD A
PROFESSOR OF HISTORY WHO UNDERSTOOD, AS FEW OTHERS UNDERSTAND, HOW TO
MAKE THIS VIEWPOINT PREVAIL IN TEACHING AND IN EXAMINING. THIS TEACHER
WAS DR. LEOPOLD POETSCH, OF THE REALSCHULE AT LINZ. HE WAS THE IDEAL
PERSONIFICATION OF THE QUALITIES NECESSARY TO A TEACHER OF HISTORY IN
THE SENSE I HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE. AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WITH A DECISIVE
MANNER BUT A KINDLY HEART, HE WAS A VERY ATTRACTIVE SPEAKER AND WAS ABLE
TO INSPIRE US WITH HIS OWN ENTHUSIASM. EVEN TO-DAY I CANNOT RECALL
WITHOUT EMOTION THAT VENERABLE PERSONALITY WHOSE ENTHUSIASTIC EXPOSITION
OF HISTORY SO OFTEN MADE US ENTIRELY FORGET THE PRESENT AND ALLOW
OURSELVES TO BE TRANSPORTED AS IF BY MAGIC INTO THE PAST. HE PENETRATED
THROUGH THE DIM MIST OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND TRANSFORMED THE
HISTORICAL MEMORY OF THE DEAD PAST INTO A LIVING REALITY. WHEN WE
LISTENED TO HIM WE BECAME AFIRE WITH ENTHUSIASM AND WE WERE SOMETIMES
MOVED EVEN TO TEARS.

IT WAS STILL MORE FORTUNATE THAT THIS PROFESSOR WAS ABLE NOT ONLY TO
ILLUSTRATE THE PAST BY EXAMPLES FROM THE PRESENT BUT FROM THE PAST HE
WAS ALSO ABLE TO DRAW A LESSON FOR THE PRESENT. HE UNDERSTOOD BETTER
THAN ANY OTHER THE EVERYDAY PROBLEMS THAT WERE THEN AGITATING OUR MINDS.
THE NATIONAL FERVOUR WHICH WE FELT IN OUR OWN SMALL WAY WAS UTILIZED BY
HIM AS AN INSTRUMENT OF OUR EDUCATION, INASMUCH AS HE OFTEN APPEALED TO
OUR NATIONAL SENSE OF HONOUR; FOR IN THAT WAY HE MAINTAINED ORDER AND
HELD OUR ATTENTION MUCH MORE EASILY THAN HE COULD HAVE DONE BY ANY OTHER
MEANS. IT WAS BECAUSE I HAD SUCH A PROFESSOR THAT HISTORY BECAME MY
FAVOURITE SUBJECT. AS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE, BUT WITHOUT THE CONSCIOUS
CONNIVANCE OF MY PROFESSOR, I THEN AND THERE BECAME A YOUNG REBEL. BUT
WHO COULD HAVE STUDIED GERMAN HISTORY UNDER SUCH A TEACHER AND NOT
BECOME AN ENEMY OF THAT STATE WHOSE RULERS EXERCISED SUCH A DISASTROUS
INFLUENCE ON THE DESTINIES OF THE GERMAN NATION? FINALLY, HOW COULD ONE
REMAIN THE FAITHFUL SUBJECT OF THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG, WHOSE PAST HISTORY
AND PRESENT CONDUCT PROVED IT TO BE READY EVER AND ALWAYS TO BETRAY THE
INTERESTS OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE FOR THE SAKE OF PALTRY PERSONAL
INTERESTS? DID NOT WE AS YOUNGSTERS FULLY REALIZE THAT THE HOUSE OF
HABSBURG DID NOT, AND COULD NOT, HAVE ANY LOVE FOR US GERMANS?

WHAT HISTORY TAUGHT US ABOUT THE POLICY FOLLOWED BY THE HOUSE OF
HABSBURG WAS CORROBORATED BY OUR OWN EVERYDAY EXPERIENCES. IN THE NORTH
AND IN THE SOUTH THE POISON OF FOREIGN RACES WAS EATING INTO THE BODY OF
OUR PEOPLE, AND EVEN VIENNA WAS STEADILY BECOMING MORE AND MORE A
NON-GERMAN CITY. THE 'IMPERIAL HOUSE' FAVOURED THE CZECHS ON EVERY
POSSIBLE OCCASION. INDEED IT WAS THE HAND OF THE GODDESS OF ETERNAL
JUSTICE AND INEXORABLE RETRIBUTION THAT CAUSED THE MOST DEADLY ENEMY OF
GERMANISM IN AUSTRIA, THE ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND, TO FALL BY THE VERY
BULLETS WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD HELPED TO CAST. WORKING FROM ABOVE
DOWNWARDS, HE WAS THE CHIEF PATRON OF THE MOVEMENT TO MAKE AUSTRIA A
SLAV STATE.

THE BURDENS LAID ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE WERE ENORMOUS AND
THE SACRIFICES OF MONEY AND BLOOD WHICH THEY HAD TO MAKE WERE INCREDIBLY
HEAVY.

YET ANYBODY WHO WAS NOT QUITE BLIND MUST HAVE SEEN THAT IT WAS ALL IN
VAIN. WHAT AFFECTED US MOST BITTERLY WAS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE FACT
THAT THIS WHOLE SYSTEM WAS MORALLY SHIELDED BY THE ALLIANCE WITH
GERMANY, WHEREBY THE SLOW EXTIRPATION OF GERMANISM IN THE OLD AUSTRIAN
MONARCHY SEEMED IN SOME WAY TO BE MORE OR LESS SANCTIONED BY GERMANY
HERSELF. HABSBURG HYPOCRISY, WHICH ENDEAVOURED OUTWARDLY TO MAKE THE
PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT AUSTRIA STILL REMAINED A GERMAN STATE, INCREASED THE
FEELING OF HATRED AGAINST THE IMPERIAL HOUSE AND AT THE SAME TIME
AROUSED A SPIRIT OF REBELLION AND CONTEMPT.

BUT IN THE GERMAN EMPIRE ITSELF THOSE WHO WERE THEN ITS RULERS SAW
NOTHING OF WHAT ALL THIS MEANT. AS IF STRUCK BLIND, THEY STOOD BESIDE A
CORPSE AND IN THE VERY SYMPTOMS OF DECOMPOSITION THEY BELIEVED THAT THEY
RECOGNIZED THE SIGNS OF A RENEWED VITALITY. IN THAT UNHAPPY ALLIANCE
BETWEEN THE YOUNG GERMAN EMPIRE AND THE ILLUSORY AUSTRIAN STATE LAY THE
GERM OF THE WORLD WAR AND ALSO OF THE FINAL COLLAPSE.

IN THE SUBSEQUENT PAGES OF THIS BOOK I SHALL GO TO THE ROOT OF THE
PROBLEM. SUFFICE IT TO SAY HERE THAT IN THE VERY EARLY YEARS OF MY YOUTH
I CAME TO CERTAIN CONCLUSIONS WHICH I HAVE NEVER ABANDONED. INDEED I
BECAME MORE PROFOUNDLY CONVINCED OF THEM AS THE YEARS PASSED. THEY WERE:
THAT THE DISSOLUTION OF THE AUSTRIAN EMPIRE IS A PRELIMINARY CONDITION
FOR THE DEFENCE OF GERMANY; FURTHER, THAT NATIONAL FEELING IS BY NO
MEANS IDENTICAL WITH DYNASTIC PATRIOTISM; FINALLY, AND ABOVE ALL, THAT
THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG WAS DESTINED TO BRING MISFORTUNE TO THE GERMAN
NATION.

AS A LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OF THESE CONVICTIONS, THERE AROSE IN ME A
FEELING OF INTENSE LOVE FOR MY GERMAN-AUSTRIAN HOME AND A PROFOUND
HATRED FOR THE AUSTRIAN STATE.

THAT KIND OF HISTORICAL THINKING WHICH WAS DEVELOPED IN ME THROUGH MY
STUDY OF HISTORY AT SCHOOL NEVER LEFT ME AFTERWARDS. WORLD HISTORY
BECAME MORE AND MORE AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF
CONTEMPORARY HISTORICAL EVENTS, WHICH MEANS POLITICS. THEREFORE I WILL
NOT "LEARN" POLITICS BUT LET POLITICS TEACH ME.

A PRECOCIOUS REVOLUTIONARY IN POLITICS I WAS NO LESS A PRECOCIOUS
REVOLUTIONARY IN ART. AT THAT TIME THE PROVINCIAL CAPITAL OF UPPER
AUSTRIA HAD A THEATRE WHICH, RELATIVELY SPEAKING, WAS NOT BAD. ALMOST
EVERYTHING WAS PLAYED THERE. WHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD I SAW WILLIAM
TELL PERFORMED. THAT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF THE THEATRE. SOME MONTHS
LATER I ATTENDED A PERFORMANCE OF LOHENGRIN, THE FIRST OPERA I HAD EVER
HEARD. I WAS FASCINATED AT ONCE. MY YOUTHFUL ENTHUSIASM FOR THE BAYREUTH
MASTER KNEW NO LIMITS. AGAIN AND AGAIN I WAS DRAWN TO HEAR HIS OPERAS;
AND TO-DAY I CONSIDER IT A GREAT PIECE OF LUCK THAT THESE MODEST
PRODUCTIONS IN THE LITTLE PROVINCIAL CITY PREPARED THE WAY AND MADE IT
POSSIBLE FOR ME TO APPRECIATE THE BETTER PRODUCTIONS LATER ON.

BUT ALL THIS HELPED TO INTENSIFY MY PROFOUND AVERSION FOR THE CAREER
THAT MY FATHER HAD CHOSEN FOR ME; AND THIS DISLIKE BECAME ESPECIALLY
STRONG AS THE ROUGH CORNERS OF YOUTHFUL BOORISHNESS BECAME WORN OFF, A
PROCESS WHICH IN MY CASE CAUSED A GOOD DEAL OF PAIN. I BECAME MORE AND
MORE CONVINCED THAT I SHOULD NEVER BE HAPPY AS A STATE OFFICIAL. AND NOW
THAT THE REALSCHULE HAD RECOGNIZED AND ACKNOWLEDGED MY APTITUDE FOR
DRAWING, MY OWN RESOLUTION BECAME ALL THE STRONGER. IMPRECATIONS AND
THREATS HAD NO LONGER ANY CHANCE OF CHANGING IT. I WANTED TO BECOME A
PAINTER AND NO POWER IN THE WORLD COULD FORCE ME TO BECOME A CIVIL
SERVANT. THE ONLY PECULIAR FEATURE OF THE SITUATION NOW WAS THAT AS I
GREW BIGGER I BECAME MORE AND MORE INTERESTED IN ARCHITECTURE. I
CONSIDERED THIS FACT AS A NATURAL DEVELOPMENT OF MY FLAIR FOR PAINTING
AND I REJOICED INWARDLY THAT THE SPHERE OF MY ARTISTIC INTERESTS WAS
THUS ENLARGED. I HAD NO NOTION THAT ONE DAY IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
OTHERWISE.

THE QUESTION OF MY CAREER WAS DECIDED MUCH SOONER THAN I COULD HAVE
EXPECTED.

WHEN I WAS IN MY THIRTEENTH YEAR MY FATHER WAS SUDDENLY TAKEN FROM US.
HE WAS STILL IN ROBUST HEALTH WHEN A STROKE OF APOPLEXY PAINLESSLY ENDED
HIS EARTHLY WANDERINGS AND LEFT US ALL DEEPLY BEREAVED. HIS MOST ARDENT
LONGING WAS TO BE ABLE TO HELP HIS SON TO ADVANCE IN A CAREER AND THUS
SAVE ME FROM THE HARSH ORDEAL THAT HE HIMSELF HAD TO GO THROUGH. BUT IT
APPEARED TO HIM THEN AS IF THAT LONGING WERE ALL IN VAIN. AND YET,
THOUGH HE HIMSELF WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF IT, HE HAD SOWN THE SEEDS OF A
FUTURE WHICH NEITHER OF US FORESAW AT THAT TIME.

AT FIRST NOTHING CHANGED OUTWARDLY.

MY MOTHER FELT IT HER DUTY TO CONTINUE MY EDUCATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH
MY FATHER'S WISHES, WHICH MEANT THAT SHE WOULD HAVE ME STUDY FOR THE
CIVIL SERVICE. FOR MY OWN PART I WAS EVEN MORE FIRMLY DETERMINED THAN
EVER BEFORE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD I BECOME AN OFFICIAL OF
THE STATE. THE CURRICULUM AND TEACHING METHODS FOLLOWED IN THE MIDDLE
SCHOOL WERE SO FAR REMOVED FROM MY IDEALS THAT I BECAME PROFOUNDLY
INDIFFERENT. ILLNESS SUDDENLY CAME TO MY ASSISTANCE. WITHIN A FEW WEEKS
IT DECIDED MY FUTURE AND PUT AN END TO THE LONG-STANDING FAMILY
CONFLICT. MY LUNGS BECAME SO SERIOUSLY AFFECTED THAT THE DOCTOR ADVISED
MY MOTHER VERY STRONGLY NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TO ALLOW ME TO TAKE
UP A CAREER WHICH WOULD NECESSITATE WORKING IN AN OFFICE. HE ORDERED
THAT I SHOULD GIVE UP ATTENDANCE AT THE REALSCHULE FOR A YEAR AT LEAST.
WHAT I HAD SECRETLY DESIRED FOR SUCH A LONG TIME, AND HAD PERSISTENTLY
FOUGHT FOR, NOW BECAME A REALITY ALMOST AT ONE STROKE.

INFLUENCED BY MY ILLNESS, MY MOTHER AGREED THAT I SHOULD LEAVE THE
REALSCHULE AND ATTEND THE ACADEMY.

THOSE WERE HAPPY DAYS, WHICH APPEARED TO ME ALMOST AS A DREAM; BUT THEY
WERE BOUND TO REMAIN ONLY A DREAM. TWO YEARS LATER MY MOTHER'S DEATH PUT
A BRUTAL END TO ALL MY FINE PROJECTS. SHE SUCCUMBED TO A LONG AND
PAINFUL ILLNESS WHICH FROM THE VERY BEGINNING PERMITTED LITTLE HOPE OF
RECOVERY. THOUGH EXPECTED, HER DEATH CAME AS A TERRIBLE BLOW TO ME. I
RESPECTED MY FATHER, BUT I LOVED MY MOTHER.

POVERTY AND STERN REALITY FORCED ME TO DECIDE PROMPTLY.

THE MEAGRE RESOURCES OF THE FAMILY HAD BEEN ALMOST ENTIRELY USED UP
THROUGH MY MOTHER'S SEVERE ILLNESS. THE ALLOWANCE WHICH CAME TO ME AS AN
ORPHAN WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE BARE NECESSITIES OF LIFE. SOMEHOW OR OTHER
I WOULD HAVE TO EARN MY OWN BREAD.

WITH MY CLOTHES AND LINEN PACKED IN A VALISE AND WITH AN INDOMITABLE
RESOLUTION IN MY HEART, I LEFT FOR VIENNA. I HOPED TO FORESTALL FATE, AS
MY FATHER HAD DONE FIFTY YEARS BEFORE. I WAS DETERMINED TO BECOME
'SOMETHING'--BUT CERTAINLY NOT A CIVIL SERVANT.




CHAPTER II



YEARS OF STUDY AND SUFFERING IN VIENNA


WHEN MY MOTHER DIED MY FATE HAD ALREADY BEEN DECIDED IN ONE RESPECT.
DURING THE LAST MONTHS OF HER ILLNESS I WENT TO VIENNA TO TAKE THE
ENTRANCE EXAMINATION FOR THE ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS. ARMED WITH A BULKY
PACKET OF SKETCHES, I FELT CONVINCED THAT I SHOULD PASS THE EXAMINATION
QUITE EASILY. AT THE REALSCHULE I WAS BY FAR THE BEST STUDENT IN THE
DRAWING CLASS, AND SINCE THAT TIME I HAD MADE MORE THAN ORDINARY
PROGRESS IN THE PRACTICE OF DRAWING. THEREFORE I WAS PLEASED WITH MYSELF
AND WAS PROUD AND HAPPY AT THE PROSPECT OF WHAT I CONSIDERED AN ASSURED
SUCCESS.

BUT THERE WAS ONE MISGIVING: IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I WAS BETTER QUALIFIED
FOR DRAWING THAN FOR PAINTING, ESPECIALLY IN THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF
ARCHITECTURAL DRAWING. AT THE SAME TIME MY INTEREST IN ARCHITECTURE WAS
CONSTANTLY INCREASING. AND I ADVANCED IN THIS DIRECTION AT A STILL MORE
RAPID PACE AFTER MY FIRST VISIT TO VIENNA, WHICH LASTED TWO WEEKS. I WAS
NOT YET SIXTEEN YEARS OLD. I WENT TO THE HOF MUSEUM TO STUDY THE
PAINTINGS IN THE ART GALLERY THERE; BUT THE BUILDING ITSELF CAPTURED
ALMOST ALL MY INTEREST, FROM EARLY MORNING UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT I SPENT
ALL MY TIME VISITING THE VARIOUS PUBLIC BUILDINGS. AND IT WAS THE
BUILDINGS THEMSELVES THAT WERE ALWAYS THE PRINCIPAL ATTRACTION FOR ME.
FOR HOURS AND HOURS I COULD STAND IN WONDERMENT BEFORE THE OPERA AND THE
PARLIAMENT. THE WHOLE RING STRASSE HAD A MAGIC EFFECT UPON ME, AS IF IT
WERE A SCENE FROM THE THOUSAND-AND-ONE-NIGHTS.

AND NOW I WAS HERE FOR THE SECOND TIME IN THIS BEAUTIFUL CITY,
IMPATIENTLY WAITING TO HEAR THE RESULT OF THE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION BUT
PROUDLY CONFIDENT THAT I HAD GOT THROUGH. I WAS SO CONVINCED OF MY
SUCCESS THAT WHEN THE NEWS THAT I HAD FAILED TO PASS WAS BROUGHT TO ME
IT STRUCK ME LIKE A BOLT FROM THE SKIES. YET THE FACT WAS THAT I HAD
FAILED. I WENT TO SEE THE RECTOR AND ASKED HIM TO EXPLAIN THE REASONS
WHY THEY REFUSED TO ACCEPT ME AS A STUDENT IN THE GENERAL SCHOOL OF
PAINTING, WHICH WAS PART OF THE ACADEMY. HE SAID THAT THE SKETCHES WHICH
I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME UNQUESTIONABLY SHOWED THAT PAINTING WAS NOT WHAT I
WAS SUITED FOR BUT THAT THE SAME SKETCHES GAVE CLEAR INDICATIONS OF MY
APTITUDE FOR ARCHITECTURAL DESIGNING. THEREFORE THE SCHOOL OF PAINTING
DID NOT COME INTO QUESTION FOR ME BUT RATHER THE SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE,
WHICH ALSO FORMED PART OF THE ACADEMY. AT FIRST IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD BE SO, SEEING THAT I HAD NEVER BEEN TO A
SCHOOL FOR ARCHITECTURE AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED ANY INSTRUCTION IN
ARCHITECTURAL DESIGNING.

WHEN I LEFT THE HANSEN PALACE, ON THE SCHILLER PLATZ, I WAS QUITE
CRESTFALLEN. I FELT OUT OF SORTS WITH MYSELF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY
YOUNG LIFE. FOR WHAT I HAD HEARD ABOUT MY CAPABILITIES NOW APPEARED TO
ME AS A LIGHTNING FLASH WHICH CLEARLY REVEALED A DUALISM UNDER WHICH I
HAD BEEN SUFFERING FOR A LONG TIME, BUT HITHERTO I COULD GIVE NO CLEAR
ACCOUNT WHATSOEVER OF THE WHY AND WHEREFORE.

WITHIN A FEW DAYS I MYSELF ALSO KNEW THAT I OUGHT TO BECOME AN
ARCHITECT. BUT OF COURSE THE WAY WAS VERY DIFFICULT. I WAS NOW FORCED
BITTERLY TO RUE MY FORMER CONDUCT IN NEGLECTING AND DESPISING CERTAIN
SUBJECTS AT THE REALSCHULE. BEFORE TAKING UP THE COURSES AT THE SCHOOL
OF ARCHITECTURE IN THE ACADEMY IT WAS NECESSARY TO ATTEND THE TECHNICAL
BUILDING SCHOOL; BUT A NECESSARY QUALIFICATION FOR ENTRANCE INTO THIS
SCHOOL WAS A LEAVING CERTIFICATE FROM THE MIDDLE SCHOOL. AND THIS I
SIMPLY DID NOT HAVE. ACCORDING TO THE HUMAN MEASURE OF THINGS MY DREAM
OF FOLLOWING AN ARTISTIC CALLING SEEMED BEYOND THE LIMITS OF
POSSIBILITY.

AFTER THE DEATH OF MY MOTHER I CAME TO VIENNA FOR THE THIRD TIME. THIS
VISIT WAS DESTINED TO LAST SEVERAL YEARS. SINCE I HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE
I HAD RECOVERED MY OLD CALM AND RESOLUTENESS. THE FORMER SELF-ASSURANCE
HAD COME BACK, AND I HAD MY EYES STEADILY FIXED ON THE GOAL. I WOULD BE
AN ARCHITECT. OBSTACLES ARE PLACED ACROSS OUR PATH IN LIFE, NOT TO BE
BOGGLED AT BUT TO BE SURMOUNTED. AND I WAS FULLY DETERMINED TO SURMOUNT
THESE OBSTACLES, HAVING THE PICTURE OF MY FATHER CONSTANTLY BEFORE MY
MIND, WHO HAD RAISED HIMSELF BY HIS OWN EFFORTS TO THE POSITION OF A
CIVIL SERVANT THOUGH HE WAS THE POOR SON OF A VILLAGE SHOEMAKER. I HAD A
BETTER START, AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF STRUGGLING THROUGH WERE BETTER.
AT THAT TIME MY LOT IN LIFE SEEMED TO ME A HARSH ONE; BUT TO-DAY I SEE
IN IT THE WISE WORKINGS OF PROVIDENCE. THE GODDESS OF FATE CLUTCHED ME
IN HER HANDS AND OFTEN THREATENED TO SMASH ME; BUT THE WILL GREW
STRONGER AS THE OBSTACLES INCREASED, AND FINALLY THE WILL TRIUMPHED.

I AM THANKFUL FOR THAT PERIOD OF MY LIFE, BECAUSE IT HARDENED ME AND
ENABLED ME TO BE AS TOUGH AS I NOW AM. AND I AM EVEN MORE THANKFUL
BECAUSE I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT I WAS THUS SAVED FROM THE EMPTINESS
OF A LIFE OF EASE AND THAT A MOTHER'S DARLING WAS TAKEN FROM TENDER ARMS
AND HANDED OVER TO ADVERSITY AS TO A NEW MOTHER. THOUGH I THEN REBELLED
AGAINST IT AS TOO HARD A FATE, I AM GRATEFUL THAT I WAS THROWN INTO A
WORLD OF MISERY AND POVERTY AND THUS CAME TO KNOW THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM I
WAS AFTERWARDS TO FIGHT.

IT WAS DURING THIS PERIOD THAT MY EYES WERE OPENED TO TWO PERILS, THE
NAMES OF WHICH I SCARCELY KNEW HITHERTO AND HAD NO NOTION WHATSOEVER OF
THEIR TERRIBLE SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE.
THESE TWO PERILS WERE MARXISM AND JUDAISM.

FOR MANY PEOPLE THE NAME OF VIENNA SIGNIFIES INNOCENT JOLLITY, A FESTIVE
PLACE FOR HAPPY MORTALS. FOR ME, ALAS, IT IS A LIVING MEMORY OF THE
SADDEST PERIOD IN MY LIFE. EVEN TO-DAY THE MENTION OF THAT CITY AROUSES
ONLY GLOOMY THOUGHTS IN MY MIND. FIVE YEARS OF POVERTY IN THAT PHAECIAN
(NOTE 5) TOWN. FIVE YEARS IN WHICH, FIRST AS A CASUAL LABOURER AND THEN AS
A PAINTER OF LITTLE TRIFLES, I HAD TO EARN MY DAILY BREAD. AND A MEAGRE
MORSEL INDEED IT WAS, NOT EVEN SUFFICIENT TO STILL THE HUNGER WHICH I
CONSTANTLY FELT. THAT HUNGER WAS THE FAITHFUL GUARDIAN WHICH NEVER LEFT
ME BUT TOOK PART IN EVERYTHING I DID. EVERY BOOK THAT I BOUGHT MEANT
RENEWED HUNGER, AND EVERY VISIT I PAID TO THE OPERA MEANT THE INTRUSION
OF THAT INALIENABL COMPANION DURING THE FOLLOWING DAYS. I WAS ALWAYS
STRUGGLING WITH MY UNSYMPATHIC FRIEND. AND YET DURING THAT TIME I
LEARNED MORE THAN I HAD EVER LEARNED BEFORE. OUTSIDE MY ARCHITECTURAL
STUDIES AND RARE VISITS TO THE OPERA, FOR WHICH I HAD TO DENY MYSELF
FOOD, I HAD NO OTHER PLEASURE IN LIFE EXCEPT MY BOOKS.

[NOTE 5. THE PHAECIANS WERE A LEGENDARY PEOPLE, MENTIONED IN HOMER'S
ODYSSEY. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO LIVE ON SOME UNKNOWN ISLAND IN THE EASTERN
MEDITERRANEAN, SOMETIMES SUGGESTED TO BE CORCYRA, THE MODERN CORFU. THEY
LOVED GOOD LIVING MORE THAN WORK, AND SO THE NAME PHAECIAN HAS COME TO BE
A SYNONYM FOR PARASITE.]

I READ A GREAT DEAL THEN, AND I PONDERED DEEPLY OVER WHAT I READ. ALL
THE FREE TIME AFTER WORK WAS DEVOTED EXCLUSIVELY TO STUDY. THUS WITHIN A
FEW YEARS I WAS ABLE TO ACQUIRE A STOCK OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH I FIND USEFUL
EVEN TO-DAY.

BUT MORE THAN THAT. DURING THOSE YEARS A VIEW OF LIFE AND A DEFINITE
OUTLOOK ON THE WORLD TOOK SHAPE IN MY MIND. THESE BECAME THE GRANITE
BASIS OF MY CONDUCT AT THAT TIME. SINCE THEN I HAVE EXTENDED THAT
FOUNDATION ONLY VERY LITTLE, AND I HAVE CHANGED NOTHING IN IT.

ON THE CONTRARY: I AM FIRMLY CONVINCED TO-DAY THAT, GENERALLY SPEAKING,
IT IS IN YOUTH THAT MEN LAY THE ESSENTIAL GROUNDWORK OF THEIR CREATIVE
THOUGHT, WHEREVER THAT CREATIVE THOUGHT EXISTS. I MAKE A DISTINCTION
BETWEEN THE WISDOM OF AGE--WHICH CAN ONLY ARISE FROM THE GREATER
PROFUNDITY AND FORESIGHT THAT ARE BASED ON THE EXPERIENCES OF A LONG
LIFE--AND THE CREATIVE GENIUS OF YOUTH, WHICH BLOSSOMS OUT IN THOUGHT
AND IDEAS WITH INEXHAUSTIBLE FERTILITY, WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO PUT THESE
INTO PRACTICE IMMEDIATELY, BECAUSE OF THEIR VERY SUPERABUNDANCE. THESE
FURNISH THE BUILDING MATERIALS AND PLANS FOR THE FUTURE; AND IT IS FROM
THEM THAT AGE TAKES THE STONES AND BUILDS THE EDIFICE, UNLESS THE
SO-CALLED WISDOM OF THE YEARS MAY HAVE SMOTHERED THE CREATIVE GENIUS OF
YOUTH.

THE LIFE WHICH I HAD HITHERTO LED AT HOME WITH MY PARENTS DIFFERED IN
LITTLE OR NOTHING FROM THAT OF ALL THE OTHERS. I LOOKED FORWARD WITHOUT
APPREHENSION TO THE MORROW, AND THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS A SOCIAL
PROBLEM TO BE FACED. THOSE AMONG WHOM I PASSED MY YOUNG DAYS BELONGED TO
THE SMALL BOURGEOIS CLASS. THEREFORE IT WAS A WORLD THAT HAD VERY LITTLE
CONTACT WITH THE WORLD OF GENUINE MANUAL LABOURERS. FOR, THOUGH AT FIRST
THIS MAY APPEAR ASTONISHING, THE DITCH WHICH SEPARATES THAT CLASS, WHICH
IS BY NO MEANS ECONOMICALLY WELL-OFF; FROM THE MANUAL LABOURING CLASS IS
OFTEN DEEPER THAN PEOPLE THINK. THE REASON FOR THIS DIVISION, WHICH WE
MAY ALMOST CALL ENMITY, LIES IN THE FEAR THAT DOMINATES A SOCIAL GROUP
WHICH HAS ONLY JUST RISEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE MANUAL LABOURER--A FEAR
LEST IT MAY FALL BACK INTO ITS OLD CONDITION OR AT LEAST BE CLASSED WITH
THE LABOURERS. MOREOVER, THERE IS SOMETHING REPULSIVE IN REMEMBERING THE
CULTURAL INDIGENCE OF THAT LOWER CLASS AND THEIR ROUGH MANNERS WITH ONE
ANOTHER; SO THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ONLY ON THE FIRST RUNG OF THE SOCIAL
LADDER FIND IT UNBEARABLE TO BE FORCED TO HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH THE
CULTURAL LEVEL AND STANDARD OF LIVING OUT OF WHICH THEY HAVE PASSED.

AND SO IT HAPPENS THAT VERY OFTEN THOSE WHO BELONG TO WHAT CAN REALLY BE
CALLED THE UPPER CLASSES FIND IT MUCH EASIER THAN DO THE UPSTARTS TO
DESCEND TO AND INTERMINGLE WITH THEIR FELLOW BEINGS ON THE LOWEST SOCIAL
LEVEL. FOR BY THE WORD UPSTART I MEAN EVERYONE WHO HAS RAISED HIMSELF
THROUGH HIS OWN EFFORTS TO A SOCIAL LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAT TO WHICH HE
FORMERLY BELONGED. IN THE CASE OF SUCH A PERSON THE HARD STRUGGLE
THROUGH WHICH HE PASSES OFTEN DESTROYS HIS NORMAL HUMAN SYMPATHY. HIS
OWN FIGHT FOR EXISTENCE KILLS HIS SENSIBILITY FOR THE MISERY OF THOSE
WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND.

FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW FATE HAD BEEN KIND TO ME. CIRCUMSTANCES FORCED
ME TO RETURN TO THAT WORLD OF POVERTY AND ECONOMIC INSECURITY ABOVE
WHICH MY FATHER HAD RAISED HIMSELF IN HIS EARLY DAYS; AND THUS THE
BLINKERS OF A NARROW PETIT BOURGEOIS EDUCATION WERE TORN FROM MY EYES.
NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME I LEARNED TO KNOW MEN AND I LEARNED TO
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN EMPTY APPEARANCES OR BRUTAL MANNERS AND THE REAL
INNER NATURE OF THE PEOPLE WHO OUTWARDLY APPEARED THUS.

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY VIENNA HAD ALREADY TAKEN RANK AMONG
THOSE CITIES WHERE SOCIAL CONDITIONS ARE INIQUITOUS. DAZZLING RICHES AND
LOATHSOME DESTITUTION WERE INTERMINGLED IN VIOLENT CONTRAST. IN THE
CENTRE AND IN THE INNER CITY ONE FELT THE PULSE-BEAT OF AN EMPIRE WHICH
HAD A POPULATION OF FIFTY-TWO MILLIONS, WITH ALL THE PERILOUS CHARM OF A
STATE MADE UP OF MULTIPLE NATIONALITIES. THE DAZZLING SPLENDOUR OF THE
COURT ACTED LIKE A MAGNET ON THE WEALTH AND INTELLIGENCE OF THE WHOLE
EMPIRE. AND THIS ATTRACTION WAS FURTHER STRENGTHENED BY THE DYNASTIC
POLICY OF THE HABSBURG MONARCHY IN CENTRALIZING EVERYTHING IN ITSELF AND
FOR ITSELF.

THIS CENTRALIZING POLICY WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO HOLD TOGETHER THAT
HOTCHPOTCH OF HETEROGENEOUS NATIONALITIES. BUT THE RESULT OF IT WAS AN
EXTRAORDINARY CONCENTRATION OF HIGHER OFFICIALS IN THE CITY, WHICH WAS
AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME THE METROPOLIS AND IMPERIAL RESIDENCE.

BUT VIENNA WAS NOT MERELY THE POLITICAL AND INTELLECTUAL CENTRE OF THE
DANUBIAN MONARCHY; IT WAS ALSO THE COMMERCIAL CENTRE. BESIDES THE HORDE
OF MILITARY OFFICERS OF HIGH RANK, STATE OFFICIALS, ARTISTS AND
SCIENTISTS, THERE WAS THE STILL VASTER HORDE OF WORKERS. ABJECT POVERTY
CONFRONTED THE WEALTH OF THE ARISTOCRACY AND THE MERCHANT CLASS FACE TO
FACE. THOUSANDS OF UNEMPLOYED LOITERED IN FRONT OF THE PALACES ON THE
RING STRASSE; AND BELOW THAT VIA TRIUMPHALIS OF THE OLD AUSTRIA THE
HOMELESS HUDDLED TOGETHER IN THE MURK AND FILTH OF THE CANALS.

THERE WAS HARDLY ANY OTHER GERMAN CITY IN WHICH THE SOCIAL PROBLEM COULD
BE STUDIED BETTER THAN IN VIENNA. BUT HERE I MUST UTTER A WARNING
AGAINST THE ILLUSION THAT THIS PROBLEM CAN BE 'STUDIED' FROM ABOVE
DOWNWARDS. THE MAN WHO HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE CLUTCHES OF THAT CRUSHING
VIPER CAN NEVER KNOW WHAT ITS POISON IS. AN ATTEMPT TO STUDY IT IN ANY
OTHER WAY WILL RESULT ONLY IN SUPERFICIAL TALK AND SENTIMENTAL
DELUSIONS. BOTH ARE HARMFUL. THE FIRST BECAUSE IT CAN NEVER GO TO THE
ROOT OF THE QUESTION, THE SECOND BECAUSE IT EVADES THE QUESTION
ENTIRELY. I DO NOT KNOW WHICH IS THE MORE NEFARIOUS: TO IGNORE SOCIAL
DISTRESS, AS DO THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN FAVOURED BY FORTUNE
AND THOSE WHO HAVE RISEN IN THE SOCIAL SCALE THROUGH THEIR OWN ROUTINE
LABOUR, OR THE EQUALLY SUPERCILIOUS AND OFTEN TACTLESS BUT ALWAYS
GENTEEL CONDESCENSION DISPLAYED BY PEOPLE WHO MAKE A FAD OF BEING
CHARITABLE AND WHO PLUME THEMSELVES ON 'SYMPATHISING WITH THE PEOPLE.'
OF COURSE SUCH PERSONS SIN MORE THAN THEY CAN IMAGINE FROM LACK OF
INSTINCTIVE UNDERSTANDING. AND THUS THEY ARE ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT THE
'SOCIAL CONSCIENCE' ON WHICH THEY PRIDE THEMSELVES NEVER PRODUCES ANY
RESULTS, BUT OFTEN CAUSES THEIR GOOD INTENTIONS TO BE RESENTED; AND THEN
THEY TALK OF THE INGRATITUDE OF THE PEOPLE.

SUCH PERSONS ARE SLOW TO LEARN THAT HERE THERE IS NO PLACE FOR MERELY
SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND THAT THERE CAN BE NO EXPECTATION OF GRATITUDE; FOR
IN THIS CONNECTION THERE IS NO QUESTION AT ALL OF DISTRIBUTING FAVOURS
BUT ESSENTIALLY A MATTER OF RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE. I WAS PROTECTED AGAINST
THE TEMPTATION TO STUDY THE SOCIAL QUESTION IN THE WAY JUST MENTIONED,
FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT I WAS FORCED TO LIVE IN THE MIDST OF
POVERTY-STRICKEN PEOPLE. THEREFORE IT WAS NOT A QUESTION OF STUDYING THE
PROBLEM OBJECTIVELY, BUT RATHER ONE OF TESTING ITS EFFECTS ON MYSELF.
THOUGH THE RABBIT CAME THROUGH THE ORDEAL OF THE EXPERIMENT, THIS MUST
NOT BE TAKEN AS EVIDENCE OF ITS HARMLESSNESS.

WHEN I TRY TO-DAY TO RECALL THE SUCCESSION OF IMPRESSIONS RECEIVED
DURING THAT TIME I FIND THAT I CAN DO SO ONLY WITH APPROXIMATE
COMPLETENESS. HERE I SHALL DESCRIBE ONLY THE MORE ESSENTIAL IMPRESSIONS
AND THOSE WHICH PERSONALLY AFFECTED ME AND OFTEN STAGGERED ME. AND I
SHALL MENTION THE FEW LESSONS I THEN LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE.

AT THAT TIME IT WAS FOR THE MOST PART NOT VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND WORK,
BECAUSE I HAD TO SEEK WORK NOT AS A SKILLED TRADESMAN BUT AS A SO-CALLED
EXTRA-HAND READY TO TAKE ANY JOB THAT TURNED UP BY CHANCE, JUST FOR THE
SAKE OF EARNING MY DAILY BREAD.

THUS I FOUND MYSELF IN THE SAME SITUATION AS ALL THOSE EMIGRANTS WHO
SHAKE THE DUST OF EUROPE FROM THEIR FEET, WITH THE CAST-IRON
DETERMINATION TO LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF A NEW EXISTENCE IN THE NEW WORLD
AND ACQUIRE FOR THEMSELVES A NEW HOME. LIBERATED FROM ALL THE PARALYSING
PREJUDICES OF CLASS AND CALLING, ENVIRONMENT AND TRADITION, THEY ENTER
ANY SERVICE THAT OPENS ITS DOORS TO THEM, ACCEPTING ANY WORK THAT COMES
THEIR WAY, FILLED MORE AND MORE WITH THE IDEA THAT HONEST WORK NEVER
DISGRACED ANYBODY, NO MATTER WHAT KIND IT MAY BE. AND SO I WAS RESOLVED
TO SET BOTH FEET IN WHAT WAS FOR ME A NEW WORLD AND PUSH FORWARD ON MY
OWN ROAD.

I SOON FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS SOME KIND OF WORK ALWAYS TO BE GOT, BUT
I ALSO LEARNED THAT IT COULD JUST AS QUICKLY AND EASILY BE LOST. THE
UNCERTAINTY OF BEING ABLE TO EARN A REGULAR DAILY LIVELIHOOD SOON
APPEARED TO ME AS THE GLOOMIEST FEATURE IN THIS NEW LIFE THAT I HAD
ENTERED.

ALTHOUGH THE SKILLED WORKER WAS NOT SO FREQUENTLY THROWN IDLE ON THE
STREETS AS THE UNSKILLED WORKER, YET THE FORMER WAS BY NO MEANS
PROTECTED AGAINST THE SAME FATE; BECAUSE THOUGH HE MAY NOT HAVE TO FACE
HUNGER AS A RESULT OF UNEMPLOYMENT DUE TO THE LACK OF DEMAND IN THE
LABOUR MARKET, THE LOCK-OUT AND THE STRIKE DEPRIVED THE SKILLED WORKER
OF THE CHANCE TO EARN HIS BREAD. HERE THE ELEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY IN
STEADILY EARNING ONE'S DAILY BREAD WAS THE BITTEREST FEATURE OF THE
WHOLE SOCIAL-ECONOMIC SYSTEM ITSELF.

THE COUNTRY LAD WHO MIGRATES TO THE BIG CITY FEELS ATTRACTED BY WHAT HAS
BEEN DESCRIBED AS EASY WORK--WHICH IT MAY BE IN REALITY--AND FEW WORKING
HOURS. HE IS ESPECIALLY ENTRANCED BY THE MAGIC GLIMMER SPREAD OVER THE
BIG CITIES. ACCUSTOMED IN THE COUNTRY TO EARN A STEADY WAGE, HE HAS BEEN
TAUGHT NOT TO QUIT HIS FORMER POST UNTIL A NEW ONE IS AT LEAST IN SIGHT.
AS THERE IS A GREAT SCARCITY OF AGRICULTURAL LABOUR, THE PROBABILITY OF
LONG UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN VERY SMALL. IT IS A MISTAKE TO
PRESUME THAT THE LAD WHO LEAVES THE COUNTRYSIDE FOR THE TOWN IS NOT MADE
OF SUCH SOUND MATERIAL AS THOSE WHO REMAIN AT HOME TO WORK ON THE LAND.
ON THE CONTRARY, EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT IT IS THE MORE HEALTHY AND MORE
VIGOROUS THAT EMIGRATE, AND NOT THE REVERSE. AMONG THESE EMIGRANTS I
INCLUDE NOT MERELY THOSE WHO EMIGRATE TO AMERICA, BUT ALSO THE SERVANT
BOY IN THE COUNTRY WHO DECIDES TO LEAVE HIS NATIVE VILLAGE AND MIGRATE
TO THE BIG CITY WHERE HE WILL BE A STRANGER. HE IS READY TO TAKE THE
RISK OF AN UNCERTAIN FATE. IN MOST CASES HE COMES TO TOWN WITH A LITTLE
MONEY IN HIS POCKET AND FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS HE IS NOT DISCOURAGED IF
HE SHOULD NOT HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND WORK. BUT IF HE FINDS A JOB
AND THEN LOSES IT IN A LITTLE WHILE, THE CASE IS MUCH WORSE. TO FIND
WORK ANEW, ESPECIALLY IN WINTER, IS OFTEN DIFFICULT AND INDEED SOMETIMES
IMPOSSIBLE. FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS LIFE IS STILL BEARABLE HE RECEIVES
HIS OUT-OF-WORK MONEY FROM HIS TRADE UNION AND IS THUS ENABLED TO CARRY
ON. BUT WHEN THE LAST OF HIS OWN MONEY IS GONE AND HIS TRADE UNION
CEASES TO PAY OUT BECAUSE OF THE PROLONGED UNEMPLOYMENT, THEN COMES THE
REAL DISTRESS. HE NOW LOITERS ABOUT AND IS HUNGRY. OFTEN HE PAWNS OR
SELLS THE LAST OF HIS BELONGINGS. HIS CLOTHES BEGIN TO GET SHABBY AND
WITH THE INCREASING POVERTY OF HIS OUTWARD APPEARANCE HE DESCENDS TO A
LOWER SOCIAL LEVEL AND MIXES UP WITH A CLASS OF HUMAN BEINGS THROUGH
WHOM HIS MIND IS NOW POISONED, IN ADDITION TO HIS PHYSICAL MISERY. THEN
HE HAS NOWHERE TO SLEEP AND IF THAT HAPPENS IN WINTER, WHICH IS VERY
OFTEN THE CASE, HE IS IN DIRE DISTRESS. FINALLY HE GETS WORK. BUT THE
OLD STORY REPEATS ITSELF. A SECOND TIME THE SAME THING HAPPENS. THEN A
THIRD TIME; AND NOW IT IS PROBABLY MUCH WORSE. LITTLE BY LITTLE HE
BECOMES INDIFFERENT TO THIS EVERLASTING INSECURITY. FINALLY HE GROWS
USED TO THE REPETITION. THUS EVEN A MAN WHO IS NORMALLY OF INDUSTRIOUS
HABITS GROWS CARELESS IN HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE TOWARDS LIFE AND GRADUALLY
BECOMES AN INSTRUMENT IN THE HANDS OF UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE WHO EXPLOIT
HIM FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR OWN IGNOBLE AIMS. HE HAS BEEN SO OFTEN THROWN
OUT OF EMPLOYMENT THROUGH NO FAULT OF HIS OWN THAT HE IS NOW MORE OR
LESS INDIFFERENT WHETHER THE STRIKE IN WHICH HE TAKES PART BE FOR THE
PURPOSE OF SECURING HIS ECONOMIC RIGHTS OR BE AIMED AT THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE STATE, THE WHOLE SOCIAL ORDER AND EVEN CIVILIZATION ITSELF.
THOUGH THE IDEA OF GOING ON STRIKE MAY NOT BE TO HIS NATURAL LIKING, YET
HE JOINS IN IT OUT OF SHEER INDIFFERENCE.

I SAW THIS PROCESS EXEMPLIFIED BEFORE MY EYES IN THOUSANDS OF CASES. AND
THE LONGER I OBSERVED IT THE GREATER BECAME MY DISLIKE FOR THAT MAMMOTH
CITY WHICH GREEDILY ATTRACTS MEN TO ITS BOSOM, IN ORDER TO BREAK THEM
MERCILESSLY IN THE END. WHEN THEY CAME THEY STILL FELT THEMSELVES IN
COMMUNION WITH THEIR OWN PEOPLE AT HOME; IF THEY REMAINED THAT TIE WAS
BROKEN.

I WAS THROWN ABOUT SO MUCH IN THE LIFE OF THE METROPOLIS THAT I
EXPERIENCED THE WORKINGS OF THIS FATE IN MY OWN PERSON AND FELT THE
EFFECTS OF IT IN MY OWN SOUL. ONE THING STOOD OUT CLEARLY BEFORE MY
EYES: IT WAS THE SUDDEN CHANGES FROM WORK TO IDLENESS AND VICE VERSA; SO
THAT THE CONSTANT FLUCTUATIONS THUS CAUSED BY EARNINGS AND EXPENDITURE
FINALLY DESTROYED THE 'SENSE OF THRIFT FOR MANY PEOPLE AND ALSO THE
HABIT OF REGULATING EXPENDITURE IN AN INTELLIGENT WAY. THE BODY APPEARED
TO GROW ACCUSTOMED TO THE VICISSITUDES OF FOOD AND HUNGER, EATING
HEARTILY IN GOOD TIMES AND GOING HUNGRY IN BAD. INDEED HUNGER SHATTERS
ALL PLANS FOR RATIONING EXPENDITURE ON A REGULAR SCALE IN BETTER TIMES
WHEN EMPLOYMENT IS AGAIN FOUND. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE
DEPRIVATIONS WHICH THE UNEMPLOYED WORKER HAS TO ENDURE MUST BE
COMPENSATED FOR PSYCHOLOGICALLY BY A PERSISTENT MENTAL MIRAGE IN WHICH
HE IMAGINES HIMSELF EATING HEARTILY ONCE AGAIN. AND THIS DREAM DEVELOPS
INTO SUCH A LONGING THAT IT TURNS INTO A MORBID IMPULSE TO CAST OFF ALL
SELF-RESTRAINT WHEN WORK AND WAGES TURN UP AGAIN. THEREFORE THE MOMENT
WORK IS FOUND ANEW HE FORGETS TO REGULATE THE EXPENDITURE OF HIS
EARNINGS BUT SPENDS THEM TO THE FULL WITHOUT THINKING OF TO-MORROW. THIS
LEADS TO CONFUSION IN THE LITTLE WEEKLY HOUSEKEEPING BUDGET, BECAUSE THE
EXPENDITURE IS NOT RATIONALLY PLANNED. WHEN THE PHENOMENON WHICH I HAVE
MENTIONED FIRST HAPPENS, THE EARNINGS WILL LAST PERHAPS FOR FIVE DAYS
INSTEAD OF SEVEN; ON SUBSEQUENT OCCASIONS THEY WILL LAST ONLY FOR THREE
DAYS; AS THE HABIT RECURS, THE EARNINGS WILL LAST SCARCELY FOR A DAY;
AND FINALLY THEY WILL DISAPPEAR IN ONE NIGHT OF FEASTING.

OFTEN THERE ARE WIFE AND CHILDREN AT HOME. AND IN MANY CASES IT HAPPENS
THAT THESE BECOME INFECTED BY SUCH A WAY OF LIVING, ESPECIALLY IF THE
HUSBAND IS GOOD TO THEM AND WANTS TO DO THE BEST HE CAN FOR THEM AND
LOVES THEM IN HIS OWN WAY AND ACCORDING TO HIS OWN LIGHTS. THEN THE
WEEK'S EARNINGS ARE SPENT IN COMMON AT HOME WITHIN TWO OR THREE DAYS.
THE FAMILY EAT AND DRINK TOGETHER AS LONG AS THE MONEY LASTS AND AT THE
END OF THE WEEK THEY HUNGER TOGETHER. THEN THE WIFE WANDERS ABOUT
FURTIVELY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, BORROWS A LITTLE, AND RUNS UP SMALL
DEBTS WITH THE SHOPKEEPERS IN AN EFFORT TO PULL THROUGH THE LEAN DAYS
TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEK. THEY SIT DOWN TOGETHER TO THE MIDDAY MEAL
WITH ONLY MEAGRE FARE ON THE TABLE, AND OFTEN EVEN NOTHING TO EAT. THEY
WAIT FOR THE COMING PAYDAY, TALKING OF IT AND MAKING PLANS; AND WHILE
THEY ARE THUS HUNGRY THEY DREAM OF THE PLENTY THAT IS TO COME. AND SO
THE LITTLE CHILDREN BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH MISERY IN THEIR EARLY YEARS.

BUT THE EVIL CULMINATES WHEN THE HUSBAND GOES HIS OWN WAY FROM THE
BEGINNING OF THE WEEK AND THE WIFE PROTESTS, SIMPLY OUT OF LOVE FOR THE
CHILDREN. THEN THERE ARE QUARRELS AND BAD FEELING AND THE HUSBAND TAKES
TO DRINK ACCORDING AS HE BECOMES ESTRANGED FROM HIS WIFE. HE NOW BECOMES
DRUNK EVERY SATURDAY. FIGHTING FOR HER OWN EXISTENCE AND THAT OF THE
CHILDREN, THE WIFE HAS TO HOUND HIM ALONG THE ROAD FROM THE FACTORY TO
THE TAVERN IN ORDER TO GET A FEW SHILLINGS FROM HIM ON PAYDAY. THEN WHEN
HE FINALLY COMES HOME, MAYBE ON THE SUNDAY OR THE MONDAY, HAVING PARTED
WITH HIS LAST SHILLINGS AND PENCE, PITIABLE SCENES FOLLOW, SCENES THAT
CRY OUT FOR GOD'S MERCY.

I HAVE HAD ACTUAL EXPERIENCE OF ALL THIS IN HUNDREDS OF CASES. AT FIRST
I WAS DISGUSTED AND INDIGNANT; BUT LATER ON I CAME TO RECOGNIZE THE
WHOLE TRAGEDY OF THEIR MISFORTUNE AND TO UNDERSTAND THE PROFOUND CAUSES
OF IT. THEY WERE THE UNHAPPY VICTIMS OF EVIL CIRCUMSTANCES.

HOUSING CONDITIONS WERE VERY BAD AT THAT TIME. THE VIENNA MANUAL
LABOURERS LIVED IN SURROUNDINGS OF APPALLING MISERY. I SHUDDER EVEN
TO-DAY WHEN I THINK OF THE WOEFUL DENS IN WHICH PEOPLE DWELT, THE NIGHT
SHELTERS AND THE SLUMS, AND ALL THE TENEBROUS SPECTACLES OF ORDURE,
LOATHSOME FILTH AND WICKEDNESS.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN ONE DAY WHEN HORDES OF EMANCIPATED SLAVES COME FORTH
FROM THESE DENS OF MISERY TO SWOOP DOWN ON THEIR UNSUSPECTING FELLOW
MEN? FOR THIS OTHER WORLD DOES NOT THINK ABOUT SUCH A POSSIBILITY. THEY
HAVE ALLOWED THESE THINGS TO GO ON WITHOUT CARING AND EVEN WITHOUT
SUSPECTING--IN THEIR TOTAL LACK OF INSTINCTIVE UNDERSTANDING--THAT
SOONER OR LATER DESTINY WILL TAKE ITS VENGEANCE UNLESS IT WILL HAVE BEEN
APPEASED IN TIME.

TO-DAY I FERVIDLY THANK PROVIDENCE FOR HAVING SENT ME TO SUCH A SCHOOL.
THERE I COULD NOT REFUSE TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN MATTERS THAT DID NOT
PLEASE ME. THIS SCHOOL SOON TAUGHT ME A PROFOUND LESSON.

IN ORDER NOT TO DESPAIR COMPLETELY OF THE PEOPLE AMONG WHOM I THEN LIVED
I HAD TO SET ON ONE SIDE THE OUTWARD APPEARANCES OF THEIR LIVES AND ON
THE OTHER THE REASONS WHY THEY HAD DEVELOPED IN THAT WAY. THEN I COULD
HEAR EVERYTHING WITHOUT DISCOURAGEMENT; FOR THOSE WHO EMERGED FROM ALL
THIS MISFORTUNE AND MISERY, FROM THIS FILTH AND OUTWARD DEGRADATION,
WERE NOT HUMAN BEINGS AS SUCH BUT RATHER LAMENTABLE RESULTS OF
LAMENTABLE LAWS. IN MY OWN LIFE SIMILAR HARDSHIPS PREVENTED ME FROM
GIVING WAY TO A PITYING SENTIMENTALITY AT THE SIGHT OF THESE DEGRADED
PRODUCTS WHICH HAD FINALLY RESULTED FROM THE PRESSURE OF CIRCUMSTANCES.
NO, THE SENTIMENTAL ATTITUDE WOULD BE THE WRONG ONE TO ADOPT.

EVEN IN THOSE DAYS I ALREADY SAW THAT THERE WAS A TWO-FOLD METHOD BY
WHICH ALONE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO BRING ABOUT AN AMELIORATION OF THESE
CONDITIONS. THIS METHOD IS: FIRST, TO CREATE BETTER FUNDAMENTAL
CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT BY ESTABLISHING A PROFOUND FEELING FOR
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES AMONG THE PUBLIC; SECOND, TO COMBINE THIS
FEELING FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES WITH A RUTHLESS DETERMINATION TO
PRUNE AWAY ALL EXCRESCENCES WHICH ARE INCAPABLE OF BEING IMPROVED.

JUST AS NATURE CONCENTRATES ITS GREATEST ATTENTION, NOT TO THE
MAINTENANCE OF WHAT ALREADY EXISTS BUT ON THE SELECTIVE BREEDING OF
OFFSPRING IN ORDER TO CARRY ON THE SPECIES, SO IN HUMAN LIFE ALSO IT IS
LESS A MATTER OF ARTIFICIALLY IMPROVING THE EXISTING GENERATION--WHICH,
OWING TO HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS, IS IMPOSSIBLE IN NINETY-NINE CASES OUT
OF A HUNDRED--AND MORE A MATTER OF SECURING FROM THE VERY START A BETTER
ROAD FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.

DURING MY STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE IN VIENNA I PERCEIVED VERY CLEARLY THAT
THE AIM OF ALL SOCIAL ACTIVITY MUST NEVER BE MERELY CHARITABLE RELIEF,
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS AND USELESS, BUT IT MUST RATHER BE A MEANS TO FIND A
WAY OF ELIMINATING THE FUNDAMENTAL DEFICIENCIES IN OUR ECONOMIC AND
CULTURAL LIFE--DEFICIENCIES WHICH NECESSARILY BRING ABOUT THE
DEGRADATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR AT LEAST LEAD HIM TOWARDS SUCH
DEGRADATION. THE DIFFICULTY OF EMPLOYING EVERY MEANS, EVEN THE MOST
DRASTIC, TO ERADICATE THE HOSTILITY PREVAILING AMONG THE WORKING CLASSES
TOWARDS THE STATE IS LARGELY DUE TO AN ATTITUDE OF UNCERTAINTY IN
DECIDING UPON THE INNER MOTIVES AND CAUSES OF THIS CONTEMPORARY
PHENOMENON. THE GROUNDS OF THIS UNCERTAINTY ARE TO BE FOUND EXCLUSIVELY
IN THE SENSE OF GUILT WHICH EACH INDIVIDUAL FEELS FOR HAVING PERMITTED
THIS TRAGEDY OF DEGRADATION. FOR THAT FEELING PARALYSES EVERY EFFORT AT
MAKING A SERIOUS AND FIRM DECISION TO ACT. AND THUS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE
WHOM IT CONCERNS ARE VACILLATING THEY ARE TIMID AND HALF-HEARTED IN
PUTTING INTO EFFECT EVEN THE MEASURES WHICH ARE INDISPENSABLE FOR
SELF-PRESERVATION. WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL IS NO LONGER BURDENED WITH HIS
OWN CONSCIOUSNESS OF BLAME IN THIS REGARD, THEN AND ONLY THEN WILL HE
HAVE THAT INNER TRANQUILLITY AND OUTER FORCE TO CUT OFF DRASTICALLY AND
RUTHLESSLY ALL THE PARASITE GROWTH AND ROOT OUT THE WEEDS.

BUT BECAUSE THE AUSTRIAN STATE HAD ALMOST NO SENSE OF SOCIAL RIGHTS OR
SOCIAL LEGISLATION ITS INABILITY TO ABOLISH THOSE EVIL EXCRESCENCES WAS
MANIFEST.

I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT APPALLED ME MOST AT THAT TIME: THE
ECONOMIC MISERY OF THOSE WHO WERE THEN MY COMPANIONS, THEIR CRUDE
CUSTOMS AND MORALS, OR THE LOW LEVEL OF THEIR INTELLECTUAL CULTURE.

HOW OFTEN OUR BOURGEOISIE RISES UP IN MORAL INDIGNATION ON HEARING FROM
THE MOUTH OF SOME PITIABLE TRAMP THAT IT IS ALL THE SAME TO HIM WHETHER
HE BE A GERMAN OR NOT AND THAT HE WILL FIND HIMSELF AT HOME WHEREVER HE
CAN GET ENOUGH TO KEEP BODY AND SOUL TOGETHER. THEY PROTEST STERNLY
AGAINST SUCH A LACK OF 'NATIONAL PRIDE' AND STRONGLY EXPRESS THEIR
HORROR AT SUCH SENTIMENTS.

BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE REALLY ASK THEMSELVES WHY IT IS THAT THEIR OWN
SENTIMENTS ARE BETTER? HOW MANY OF THEM UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR NATURAL
PRIDE IN BEING MEMBERS OF SO FAVOURED A NATION ARISES FROM THE
INNUMERABLE SUCCESSION OF INSTANCES THEY HAVE ENCOUNTERED WHICH REMIND
THEM OF THE GREATNESS OF THE FATHERLAND AND THE NATION IN ALL SPHERES OF
ARTISTIC AND CULTURAL LIFE? HOW MANY OF THEM REALIZE THAT PRIDE IN THE
FATHERLAND IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON KNOWLEDGE OF ITS GREATNESS IN ALL
THOSE SPHERES? DO OUR BOURGEOIS CIRCLES EVER THINK WHAT A RIDICULOUSLY
MEAGRE SHARE THE PEOPLE HAVE IN THAT KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS A NECESSARY
PREREQUISITE FOR THE FEELING OF PRIDE IN ONE'S FATHERLAND?

IT CANNOT BE OBJECTED HERE THAT IN OTHER COUNTRIES SIMILAR CONDITIONS
EXIST AND THAT NEVERTHELESS THE WORKING CLASSES IN THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE
REMAINED PATRIOTIC. EVEN IF THAT WERE SO, IT WOULD BE NO EXCUSE FOR OUR
NEGLIGENT ATTITUDE. BUT IT IS NOT SO. WHAT WE CALL CHAUVINISTIC
EDUCATION--IN THE CASE OF THE FRENCH PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE--IS ONLY THE
EXCESSIVE EXALTATION OF THE GREATNESS OF FRANCE IN ALL SPHERES OF
CULTURE OR, AS THE FRENCH SAY, CIVILIZATION. THE FRENCH BOY IS NOT
EDUCATED ON PURELY OBJECTIVE PRINCIPLES. WHEREVER THE IMPORTANCE OF THE
POLITICAL AND CULTURAL GREATNESS OF HIS COUNTRY IS CONCERNED HE IS
TAUGHT IN THE MOST SUBJECTIVE WAY THAT ONE CAN IMAGINE.

THIS EDUCATION WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO BE CONFINED TO GENERAL IDEAS IN A
LARGE PERSPECTIVE AND THESE OUGHT TO BE DEEPLY ENGRAVEN, BY CONSTANT
REPETITION IF NECESSARY, ON THE MEMORIES AND FEELINGS OF THE PEOPLE.

IN OUR CASE, HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT MERELY GUILTY OF NEGATIVE SINS OF
OMISSION BUT ALSO OF POSITIVELY PERVERTING THE LITTLE WHICH SOME
INDIVIDUALS HAD THE LUCK TO LEARN AT SCHOOL. THE RATS THAT POISON OUR
BODY-POLITIC GNAW FROM THE HEARTS AND MEMORIES OF THE BROAD MASSES EVEN
THAT LITTLE WHICH DISTRESS AND MISERY HAVE LEFT.

LET THE READER TRY TO PICTURE THE FOLLOWING:

THERE IS A LODGING IN A CELLAR AND THIS LODGING CONSISTS OF TWO DAMP
ROOMS. IN THESE ROOMS A WORKMAN AND HIS FAMILY LIVE--SEVEN PEOPLE IN
ALL. LET US ASSUME THAT ONE OF THE CHILDREN IS A BOY OF THREE YEARS.
THAT IS THE AGE AT WHICH CHILDREN FIRST BECOME CONSCIOUS OF THE
IMPRESSIONS WHICH THEY RECEIVE. IN THE CASE OF HIGHLY GIFTED PEOPLE
TRACES OF THE IMPRESSIONS RECEIVED IN THOSE EARLY YEARS LAST IN THE
MEMORY UP TO AN ADVANCED AGE. NOW THE NARROWNESS AND CONGESTION OF THOSE
LIVING QUARTERS DO NOT CONDUCE TO PLEASANT INTER-RELATIONS. THUS
QUARRELS AND FITS OF MUTUAL ANGER ARISE. THESE PEOPLE CAN HARDLY BE SAID
TO LIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER, BUT RATHER DOWN ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER. THE
SMALL MISUNDERSTANDINGS WHICH DISAPPEAR OF THEMSELVES IN A HOME WHERE
THERE IS ENOUGH SPACE FOR PEOPLE TO GO APART FROM ONE ANOTHER FOR A
WHILE, HERE BECOME THE SOURCE OF CHRONIC DISPUTES. AS FAR AS THE
CHILDREN ARE CONCERNED THE SITUATION IS TOLERABLE FROM THIS POINT OF
VIEW. IN SUCH CONDITIONS THEY ARE CONSTANTLY QUARRELLING WITH ONE
ANOTHER, BUT THE QUARRELS ARE QUICKLY AND ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN. BUT WHEN
THE PARENTS FALL OUT WITH ONE ANOTHER THESE DAILY BICKERINGS OFTEN
DESCEND TO RUDENESS SUCH AS CANNOT BE ADEQUATELY IMAGINED. THE RESULTS
OF SUCH EXPERIENCES MUST BECOME APPARENT LATER ON IN THE CHILDREN. ONE
MUST HAVE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE OF SUCH A MILIEU SO AS TO BE ABLE TO
PICTURE THE STATE OF AFFAIRS THAT ARISES FROM THESE MUTUAL
RECRIMINATIONS WHEN THE FATHER PHYSICALLY ASSAULTS THE MOTHER AND
MALTREATS HER IN A FIT OF DRUNKEN RAGE. AT THE AGE OF SIX THE CHILD CAN
NO LONGER IGNORE THOSE SORDID DETAILS WHICH EVEN AN ADULT WOULD FIND
REVOLTING. INFECTED WITH MORAL POISON, BODILY UNDERNOURISHED, AND THE
POOR LITTLE HEAD FILLED WITH VERMIN, THE YOUNG 'CITIZEN' GOES TO THE
PRIMARY SCHOOL. WITH DIFFICULTY HE BARELY LEARNS TO READ AND WRITE.
THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF LEARNING ANY LESSONS AT HOME. QUITE THE
CONTRARY. THE FATHER AND MOTHER THEMSELVES TALK BEFORE THE CHILDREN IN
THE MOST DISPARAGING WAY ABOUT THE TEACHER AND THE SCHOOL AND THEY ARE
MUCH MORE INCLINED TO INSULT THE TEACHERS THAN TO PUT THEIR OFFSPRING
ACROSS THE KNEE AND KNOCK SOUND REASON INTO HIM. WHAT THE LITTLE FELLOW
HEARS AT HOME DOES NOT TEND TO INCREASE RESPECT FOR HIS HUMAN
SURROUNDINGS. HERE NOTHING GOOD IS SAID OF HUMAN NATURE AS A WHOLE AND
EVERY INSTITUTION, FROM THE SCHOOL TO THE GOVERNMENT, IS REVILED.
WHETHER RELIGION AND MORALS ARE CONCERNED OR THE STATE AND THE SOCIAL
ORDER, IT IS ALL THE SAME; THEY ARE ALL SCOFFED AT. WHEN THE YOUNG LAD
LEAVES SCHOOL, AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT
ARE THE MOST STRIKING FEATURES OF HIS CHARACTER, INCREDIBLE IGNORANCE IN
SO FAR AS REAL KNOWLEDGE IS CONCERNED OR CYNICAL IMPUDENCE COMBINED WITH
AN ATTITUDE TOWARDS MORALITY WHICH IS REALLY STARTLING AT SO YOUNG AN
AGE.

WHAT STATION IN LIFE CAN SUCH A PERSON FILL, TO WHOM NOTHING IS SACRED,
WHO HAS NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING NOBLE BUT, ON THE CONTRARY, HAS BEEN
INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH THE LOWEST KIND OF HUMAN EXISTENCE? THIS
CHILD OF THREE HAS GOT INTO THE HABIT OF REVILING ALL AUTHORITY BY THE
TIME HE IS FIFTEEN. HE HAS BEEN ACQUAINTED ONLY WITH MORAL FILTH AND
VILENESS, EVERYTHING BEING EXCLUDED THAT MIGHT STIMULATE HIS THOUGHT
TOWARDS HIGHER THINGS. AND NOW THIS YOUNG SPECIMEN OF HUMANITY ENTERS
THE SCHOOL OF LIFE.

HE LEADS THE SAME KIND OF LIFE WHICH WAS EXEMPLIFIED FOR HIM BY HIS
FATHER DURING HIS CHILDHOOD. HE LOITERS ABOUT AND COMES HOME AT ALL
HOURS. HE NOW EVEN BLACK-GUARDS THAT BROKEN-HEARTED BEING WHO GAVE HIM
BIRTH. HE CURSES GOD AND THE WORLD AND FINALLY ENDS UP IN A HOUSE OF
CORRECTION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. THERE HE GETS THE FINAL POLISH.

AND HIS BOURGEOIS CONTEMPORARIES ARE ASTONISHED AT THE LACK OF
'PATRIOTIC ENTHUSIASM' WHICH THIS YOUNG 'CITIZEN' MANIFESTS.

DAY AFTER DAY THE BOURGEOIS WORLD ARE WITNESSES TO THE PHENOMENON OF
SPREADING POISON AMONG THE PEOPLE THROUGH THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE
THEATRE AND THE CINEMA, GUTTER JOURNALISM AND OBSCENE BOOKS; AND YET
THEY ARE ASTONISHED AT THE DEPLORABLE 'MORAL STANDARDS' AND 'NATIONAL
INDIFFERENCE' OF THE MASSES. AS IF THE CINEMA BILGE AND THE GUTTER PRESS
AND SUCHLIKE COULD INCULCATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GREATNESS OF ONE'S
COUNTRY, APART ENTIRELY FROM THE EARLIER EDUCATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL.

I THEN CAME TO UNDERSTAND, QUICKLY AND THOROUGHLY, WHAT I HAD NEVER BEEN
AWARE OF BEFORE. IT WAS THE FOLLOWING:

THE QUESTION OF 'NATIONALIZING' A PEOPLE IS FIRST AND FOREMOST ONE OF
ESTABLISHING HEALTHY SOCIAL CONDITIONS WHICH WILL FURNISH THE GROUNDS
THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL. FOR ONLY WHEN
FAMILY UPBRINGING AND SCHOOL EDUCATION HAVE INCULCATED IN THE INDIVIDUAL
A KNOWLEDGE OF THE CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC AND, ABOVE ALL, THE POLITICAL
GREATNESS OF HIS OWN COUNTRY--THEN, AND THEN ONLY, WILL IT BE POSSIBLE
FOR HIM TO FEEL PROUD OF BEING A CITIZEN OF SUCH A COUNTRY. I CAN FIGHT
ONLY FOR SOMETHING THAT I LOVE. I CAN LOVE ONLY WHAT I RESPECT. AND IN
ORDER TO RESPECT A THING I MUST AT LEAST HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE OF IT.

AS SOON AS MY INTEREST IN SOCIAL QUESTIONS WAS ONCE AWAKENED I BEGAN TO
STUDY THEM IN A FUNDAMENTAL WAY. A NEW AND HITHERTO UNKNOWN WORLD WAS
THUS REVEALED TO ME.

IN THE YEARS 1909-10 I HAD SO FAR IMPROVED MY, POSITION THAT I NO LONGER
HAD TO EARN MY DAILY BREAD AS A MANUAL LABOURER. I WAS NOW WORKING
INDEPENDENTLY AS DRAUGHTSMAN, AND PAINTER IN WATER COLOURS. THIS MÃ‰TIER
WAS A POOR ONE INDEED AS FAR AS EARNINGS WERE CONCERNED; FOR THESE WERE
ONLY SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE BARE EXIGENCIES OF LIFE. YET IT HAD AN
INTEREST FOR ME IN VIEW OF THE PROFESSION TO WHICH I ASPIRED. MOREOVER,
WHEN I CAME HOME IN THE EVENINGS I WAS NOW NO LONGER DEAD-TIRED AS
FORMERLY, WHEN I USED TO BE UNABLE TO LOOK INTO A BOOK WITHOUT FALLING
ASLEEP ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. MY PRESENT OCCUPATION THEREFORE WAS IN LINE
WITH THE PROFESSION I AIMED AT FOR THE FUTURE. MOREOVER, I WAS MASTER OF
MY OWN TIME AND COULD DISTRIBUTE MY WORKING-HOURS NOW BETTER THAN
FORMERLY. I PAINTED IN ORDER TO EARN MY BREAD, AND I STUDIED BECAUSE I
LIKED IT.

THUS I WAS ABLE TO ACQUIRE THAT THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE SOCIAL
PROBLEM WHICH WAS A NECESSARY COMPLEMENT TO WHAT I WAS LEARNING THROUGH
ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. I STUDIED ALL THE BOOKS WHICH I COULD FIND THAT DEALT
WITH THIS QUESTION AND I THOUGHT DEEPLY ON WHAT I READ. I THINK THAT THE
MILIEU IN WHICH I THEN LIVED CONSIDERED ME AN ECCENTRIC PERSON.

BESIDES MY INTEREST IN THE SOCIAL QUESTION I NATURALLY DEVOTED MYSELF
WITH ENTHUSIASM TO THE STUDY OF ARCHITECTURE. SIDE BY SIDE WITH MUSIC, I
CONSIDERED IT QUEEN OF THE ARTS. TO STUDY IT WAS FOR ME NOT WORK BUT
PLEASURE. I COULD READ OR DRAW UNTIL THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
WITHOUT EVER GETTING TIRED. AND I BECAME MORE AND MORE CONFIDENT THAT MY
DREAM OF A BRILLIANT FUTURE WOULD BECOME TRUE, EVEN THOUGH I SHOULD HAVE
TO WAIT LONG YEARS FOR ITS FULFILMENT. I WAS FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT ONE
DAY I SHOULD MAKE A NAME FOR MYSELF AS AN ARCHITECT.

THE FACT THAT, SIDE BY SIDE WITH MY PROFESSIONAL STUDIES, I TOOK THE
GREATEST INTEREST IN EVERYTHING THAT HAD TO DO WITH POLITICS DID NOT
SEEM TO ME TO SIGNIFY ANYTHING OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. ON THE CONTRARY: I
LOOKED UPON THIS PRACTICAL INTEREST IN POLITICS MERELY AS PART OF AN
ELEMENTARY OBLIGATION THAT DEVOLVES ON EVERY THINKING MAN. THOSE WHO
HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OF THE POLITICAL WORLD AROUND THEM HAVE NO RIGHT
TO CRITICIZE OR COMPLAIN. ON POLITICAL QUESTIONS THEREFORE I STILL
CONTINUED TO READ AND STUDY A GREAT DEAL. BUT READING HAD PROBABLY A
DIFFERENT SIGNIFICANCE FOR ME FROM THAT WHICH IT HAS FOR THE AVERAGE RUN
OF OUR SO-CALLED 'INTELLECTUALS'.

I KNOW PEOPLE WHO READ INTERMINABLY, BOOK AFTER BOOK, FROM PAGE TO PAGE,
AND YET I SHOULD NOT CALL THEM 'WELL-READ PEOPLE'. OF COURSE THEY 'KNOW'
AN IMMENSE AMOUNT; BUT THEIR BRAIN SEEMS INCAPABLE OF ASSORTING AND
CLASSIFYING THE MATERIAL WHICH THEY HAVE GATHERED FROM BOOKS. THEY HAVE
NOT THE FACULTY OF DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN WHAT IS USEFUL AND USELESS IN
A BOOK; SO THAT THEY MAY RETAIN THE FORMER IN THEIR MINDS AND IF
POSSIBLE SKIP OVER THE LATTER WHILE READING IT, IF THAT BE NOT POSSIBLE,
THEN--WHEN ONCE READ--THROW IT OVERBOARD AS USELESS BALLAST. READING IS
NOT AN END IN ITSELF, BUT A MEANS TO AN END. ITS CHIEF PURPOSE IS TO
HELP TOWARDS FILLING IN THE FRAMEWORK WHICH IS MADE UP OF THE TALENTS
AND CAPABILITIES THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL POSSESSES. THUS EACH ONE PROCURES
FOR HIMSELF THE IMPLEMENTS AND MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR THE FULFILMENT OF
HIS CALLING IN LIFE, NO MATTER WHETHER THIS BE THE ELEMENTARY TASK OF
EARNING ONE'S DAILY BREAD OR A CALLING THAT RESPONDS TO HIGHER HUMAN
ASPIRATIONS. SUCH IS THE FIRST PURPOSE OF READING. AND THE SECOND
PURPOSE IS TO GIVE A GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE. IN
BOTH CASES, HOWEVER, THE MATERIAL WHICH ONE HAS ACQUIRED THROUGH READING
MUST NOT BE STORED UP IN THE MEMORY ON A PLAN THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE
SUCCESSIVE CHAPTERS OF THE BOOK; BUT EACH LITTLE PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE THUS
GAINED MUST BE TREATED AS IF IT WERE A LITTLE STONE TO BE INSERTED INTO
A MOSAIC, SO THAT IT FINDS ITS PROPER PLACE AMONG ALL THE OTHER PIECES
AND PARTICLES THAT HELP TO FORM A GENERAL WORLD-PICTURE IN THE BRAIN OF
THE READER. OTHERWISE ONLY A CONFUSED JUMBLE OF CHAOTIC NOTIONS WILL
RESULT FROM ALL THIS READING. THAT JUMBLE IS NOT MERELY USELESS, BUT IT
ALSO TENDS TO MAKE THE UNFORTUNATE POSSESSOR OF IT CONCEITED. FOR HE
SERIOUSLY CONSIDERS HIMSELF A WELL-EDUCATED PERSON AND THINKS THAT HE
UNDERSTANDS SOMETHING OF LIFE. HE BELIEVES THAT HE HAS ACQUIRED
KNOWLEDGE, WHEREAS THE TRUTH IS THAT EVERY INCREASE IN SUCH 'KNOWLEDGE'
DRAWS HIM MORE AND MORE AWAY FROM REAL LIFE, UNTIL HE FINALLY ENDS UP IN
SOME SANATORIUM OR TAKES TO POLITICS AND BECOMES A PARLIAMENTARY DEPUTY.

SUCH A PERSON NEVER SUCCEEDS IN TURNING HIS KNOWLEDGE TO PRACTICAL
ACCOUNT WHEN THE OPPORTUNE MOMENT ARRIVES; FOR HIS MENTAL EQUIPMENT IS
NOT ORDERED WITH A VIEW TO MEETING THE DEMANDS OF EVERYDAY LIFE. HIS
KNOWLEDGE IS STORED IN HIS BRAIN AS A LITERAL TRANSCRIPT OF THE BOOKS HE
HAS READ AND THE ORDER OF SUCCESSION IN WHICH HE HAS READ THEM. AND IF
FATE SHOULD ONE DAY CALL UPON HIM TO USE SOME OF HIS BOOK-KNOWLEDGE FOR
CERTAIN PRACTICAL ENDS IN LIFE THAT VERY CALL WILL HAVE TO NAME THE BOOK
AND GIVE THE NUMBER OF THE PAGE; FOR THE POOR NOODLE HIMSELF WOULD NEVER
BE ABLE TO FIND THE SPOT WHERE HE GATHERED THE INFORMATION NOW CALLED
FOR. BUT IF THE PAGE IS NOT MENTIONED AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT THE
WIDELY-READ INTELLECTUAL WILL FIND HIMSELF IN A STATE OF HOPELESS
EMBARRASSMENT. IN A HIGH STATE OF AGITATION HE SEARCHES FOR ANALOGOUS
CASES AND IT IS ALMOST A DEAD CERTAINTY THAT HE WILL FINALLY DELIVER THE
WRONG PRESCRIPTION.

IF THAT IS NOT A CORRECT DESCRIPTION, THEN HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN THE
POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF OUR PARLIAMENTARY HEROES WHO HOLD THE HIGHEST
POSITIONS IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY? OTHERWISE WE SHOULD HAVE TO
ATTRIBUTE THE DOINGS OF SUCH POLITICAL LEADERS, NOT TO PATHOLOGICAL
CONDITIONS BUT SIMPLY TO MALICE AND CHICANERY.

ON THE OTHER HAND, ONE WHO HAS CULTIVATED THE ART OF READING WILL
INSTANTLY DISCERN, IN A BOOK OR JOURNAL OR PAMPHLET, WHAT OUGHT TO BE
REMEMBERED BECAUSE IT MEETS ONE'S PERSONAL NEEDS OR IS OF VALUE AS
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE. WHAT HE THUS LEARNS IS INCORPORATED IN HIS MENTAL
ANALOGUE OF THIS OR THAT PROBLEM OR THING, FURTHER CORRECTING THE MENTAL
PICTURE OR ENLARGING IT SO THAT IT BECOMES MORE EXACT AND PRECISE.
SHOULD SOME PRACTICAL PROBLEM SUDDENLY DEMAND EXAMINATION OR SOLUTION,
MEMORY WILL IMMEDIATELY SELECT THE OPPORTUNE INFORMATION FROM THE MASS
THAT HAS BEEN ACQUIRED THROUGH YEARS OF READING AND WILL PLACE THIS
INFORMATION AT THE SERVICE OF ONE'S POWERS OF JUDGMENT SO AS TO GET A
NEW AND CLEARER VIEW OF THE PROBLEM IN QUESTION OR PRODUCE A DEFINITIVE
SOLUTION.

ONLY THUS CAN READING HAVE ANY MEANING OR BE WORTH WHILE.

THE SPEAKER, FOR EXAMPLE, WHO HAS NOT THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION READY
TO HAND WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO A PROPER TREATMENT OF HIS SUBJECT IS
UNABLE TO DEFEND HIS OPINIONS AGAINST AN OPPONENT, EVEN THOUGH THOSE
OPINIONS BE PERFECTLY SOUND AND TRUE. IN EVERY DISCUSSION HIS MEMORY
WILL LEAVE HIM SHAMEFULLY IN THE LURCH. HE CANNOT SUMMON UP ARGUMENTS TO
SUPPORT HIS STATEMENTS OR TO REFUTE HIS OPPONENT. SO LONG AS THE SPEAKER
HAS ONLY TO DEFEND HIMSELF ON HIS OWN PERSONAL ACCOUNT, THE SITUATION IS
NOT SERIOUS; BUT THE EVIL COMES WHEN CHANCE PLACES AT THE HEAD OF PUBLIC
AFFAIRS SUCH A SOI-DISANT KNOW-IT-ALL, WHO IN REALITY KNOWS NOTHING.

FROM EARLY YOUTH I ENDEAVOURED TO READ BOOKS IN THE RIGHT WAY AND I WAS
FORTUNATE IN HAVING A GOOD MEMORY AND INTELLIGENCE TO ASSIST ME. FROM
THAT POINT OF VIEW MY SOJOURN IN VIENNA WAS PARTICULARLY USEFUL AND
PROFITABLE. MY EXPERIENCES OF EVERYDAY LIFE THERE WERE A CONSTANT
STIMULUS TO STUDY THE MOST DIVERSE PROBLEMS FROM NEW ANGLES. INASMUCH AS
I WAS IN A POSITION TO PUT THEORY TO THE TEST OF REALITY AND REALITY TO
THE TEST OF THEORY, I WAS SAFE FROM THE DANGER OF PEDANTIC THEORIZING ON
THE ONE HAND AND, ON THE OTHER, FROM BEING TOO IMPRESSED BY THE
SUPERFICIAL ASPECTS OF REALITY.

THE EXPERIENCE OF EVERYDAY LIFE AT THAT TIME DETERMINED ME TO MAKE A
FUNDAMENTAL THEORETICAL STUDY OF TWO MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OUTSIDE OF
THE SOCIAL QUESTION.

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHEN I MIGHT HAVE STARTED TO MAKE A THOROUGH
STUDY OF THE DOCTRINE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF MARXISM WERE IT NOT FOR THE
FACT THAT I THEN LITERALLY RAN HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE PROBLEM.

WHAT I KNEW OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY IN MY YOUTH WAS PRECIOUS LITTLE AND THAT
LITTLE WAS FOR THE MOST PART WRONG. THE FACT THAT IT LED THE STRUGGLE
FOR UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE AND THE SECRET BALLOT GAVE ME AN INNER
SATISFACTION; FOR MY REASON THEN TOLD ME THAT THIS WOULD WEAKEN THE
HABSBURG REGIME, WHICH I SO THOROUGHLY DETESTED. I WAS CONVINCED THAT
EVEN IF IT SHOULD SACRIFICE THE GERMAN ELEMENT THE DANUBIAN STATE COULD
NOT CONTINUE TO EXIST. EVEN AT THE PRICE OF A LONG AND SLOW SLAVIZ-ATION
OF THE AUSTRIAN GERMANS THE STATE WOULD SECURE NO GUARANTEE OF A REALLY
DURABLE EMPIRE; BECAUSE IT WAS VERY QUESTIONABLE IF AND HOW FAR THE
SLAVS POSSESSED THE NECESSARY CAPACITY FOR CONSTRUCTIVE POLITICS.
THEREFORE I WELCOMED EVERY MOVEMENT THAT MIGHT LEAD TOWARDS THE FINAL
DISRUPTION OF THAT IMPOSSIBLE STATE WHICH HAD DECREED THAT IT WOULD
STAMP OUT THE GERMAN CHARACTER IN TEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. THE MORE THIS
BABEL OF TONGUES WROUGHT DISCORD AND DISRUPTION, EVEN IN THE PARLIAMENT,
THE NEARER THE HOUR APPROACHED FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF THIS BABYLONIAN
EMPIRE. THAT WOULD MEAN THE LIBERATION OF MY GERMAN AUSTRIAN PEOPLE, AND
ONLY THEN WOULD IT BECOME POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO BE RE-UNITED TO THE
MOTHERLAND.

ACCORDINGLY I HAD NO FEELINGS OF ANTIPATHY TOWARDS THE ACTUAL POLICY OF
THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS. THAT ITS AVOWED PURPOSE WAS TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF
THE WORKING CLASSES--WHICH IN MY IGNORANCE I THEN FOOLISHLY
BELIEVED--WAS A FURTHER REASON WHY I SHOULD SPEAK IN FAVOUR OF SOCIAL
DEMOCRACY RATHER THAN AGAINST IT. BUT THE FEATURES THAT CONTRIBUTED MOST
TO ESTRANGE ME FROM THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT WAS ITS HOSTILE
ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE STRUGGLE FOR THE CONSERVATION OF GERMANISM IN
AUSTRIA, ITS LAMENTABLE COCOTTING WITH THE SLAV 'COMRADES', WHO RECEIVED
THESE APPROACHES FAVOURABLY AS LONG AS ANY PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES WERE
FORTHCOMING BUT OTHERWISE MAINTAINED A HAUGHTY RESERVE, THUS GIVING THE
IMPORTUNATE MENDICANTS THE SORT OF ANSWER THEIR BEHAVIOUR DESERVED.

AND SO AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN THE WORD 'MARXISM' WAS VERY LITTLE KNOWN
TO ME, WHILE I LOOKED ON 'SOCIAL DEMOCRACY' AND 'SOCIALISM' AS
SYNONYMOUS EXPRESSIONS. IT WAS ONLY AS THE RESULT OF A SUDDEN BLOW FROM
THE ROUGH HAND OF FATE THAT MY EYES WERE OPENED TO THE NATURE OF THIS
UNPARALLELED SYSTEM FOR DUPING THE PUBLIC.

HITHERTO MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY WAS ONLY THAT
OF A MERE SPECTATOR AT SOME OF THEIR MASS MEETINGS. I HAD NOT THE
SLIGHTEST IDEA OF THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC TEACHING OR THE MENTALITY OF ITS
PARTISANS. ALL OF A SUDDEN I WAS BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH THE PRODUCTS
OF THEIR TEACHING AND WHAT THEY CALLED THEIR WELTANSCHAUUNG. IN THIS
WAY A FEW MONTHS SUFFICED FOR ME TO LEARN SOMETHING WHICH UNDER OTHER
CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT HAVE NECESSITATED DECADES OF STUDY--NAMELY, THAT
UNDER THE CLOAK OF SOCIAL VIRTUE AND LOVE OF ONE'S NEIGHBOUR A VERITABLE
PESTILENCE WAS SPREADING ABROAD AND THAT IF THIS PESTILENCE BE NOT
STAMPED OUT OF THE WORLD WITHOUT DELAY IT MAY EVENTUALLY SUCCEED IN
EXTERMINATING THE HUMAN RACE.

I FIRST CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS WHILE WORKING IN THE
BUILDING TRADE.

FROM THE VERY TIME THAT I STARTED WORK THE SITUATION WAS NOT VERY
PLEASANT FOR ME. MY CLOTHES WERE STILL RATHER DECENT. I WAS CAREFUL OF
MY SPEECH AND I WAS RESERVED IN MANNER. I WAS SO OCCUPIED WITH THINKING
OF MY OWN PRESENT LOT AND FUTURE POSSIBILITIES THAT I DID NOT TAKE MUCH
OF AN INTEREST IN MY IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS. I HAD SOUGHT WORK SO THAT I
SHOULDN'T STARVE AND AT THE SAME TIME SO AS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE FURTHER
HEADWAY WITH MY STUDIES, THOUGH THIS HEADWAY MIGHT BE SLOW. POSSIBLY I
SHOULD NOT HAVE BOTHERED TO BE INTERESTED IN MY COMPANIONS WERE IT NOT
THAT ON THE THIRD OR FOURTH DAY AN EVENT OCCURRED WHICH FORCED ME TO
TAKE A DEFINITE STAND. I WAS ORDERED TO JOIN THE TRADE UNION.

AT THAT TIME I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE TRADES UNIONS. I HAD HAD NO
OPPORTUNITY OF FORMING AN OPINION ON THEIR UTILITY OR INUTILITY, AS THE
CASE MIGHT BE. BUT WHEN I WAS TOLD THAT I MUST JOIN THE UNION I REFUSED.
THE GROUNDS WHICH I GAVE FOR MY REFUSAL WERE SIMPLY THAT I KNEW NOTHING
ABOUT THE MATTER AND THAT ANYHOW I WOULD NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO BE FORCED
INTO ANYTHING. PROBABLY THE FORMER REASON SAVED ME FROM BEING THROWN OUT
RIGHT AWAY. THEY PROBABLY THOUGHT THAT WITHIN A FEW DAYS I MIGHT BE
CONVERTED' AND BECOME MORE DOCILE. BUT IF THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE
PROFOUNDLY MISTAKEN. AFTER TWO WEEKS I FOUND IT UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR
ME TO TAKE SUCH A STEP, EVEN IF I HAD BEEN WILLING TO TAKE IT AT FIRST.
DURING THOSE FOURTEEN DAYS I CAME TO KNOW MY FELLOW WORKMEN BETTER, AND
NO POWER IN THE WORLD COULD HAVE MOVED ME TO JOIN AN ORGANIZATION WHOSE
REPRESENTATIVES HAD MEANWHILE SHOWN THEMSELVES IN A LIGHT WHICH I FOUND
SO UNFAVOURABLE.

DURING THE FIRST DAYS MY RESENTMENT WAS AROUSED.

AT MIDDAY SOME OF MY FELLOW WORKERS USED TO ADJOURN TO THE NEAREST
TAVERN, WHILE THE OTHERS REMAINED ON THE BUILDING PREMISES AND THERE ATE
THEIR MIDDAY MEAL, WHICH IN MOST CASES WAS A VERY SCANTY ONE. THESE WERE
MARRIED MEN. THEIR WIVES BROUGHT THEM THE MIDDAY SOUP IN DILAPIDATED
VESSELS. TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEK THERE WAS A GRADUAL INCREASE IN THE
NUMBER OF THOSE WHO REMAINED TO EAT THEIR MIDDAY MEAL ON THE BUILDING
PREMISES. I UNDERSTOOD THE REASON FOR THIS AFTERWARDS. THEY NOW TALKED
POLITICS.

I DRANK MY BOTTLE OF MILK AND ATE MY MORSEL OF BREAD SOMEWHERE ON THE
OUTSKIRTS, WHILE I CIRCUMSPECTLY STUDIED MY ENVIRONMENT OR ELSE FELL TO
MEDITATING ON MY OWN HARSH LOT. YET I HEARD MORE THAN ENOUGH. AND I
OFTEN THOUGHT THAT SOME OF WHAT THEY SAID WAS MEANT FOR MY EARS, IN THE
HOPE OF BRINGING ME TO A DECISION. BUT ALL THAT I HEARD HAD THE EFFECT
OF AROUSING THE STRONGEST ANTAGONISM IN ME. EVERYTHING WAS
DISPARAGED--THE NATION, BECAUSE IT WAS HELD TO BE AN INVENTION OF THE
'CAPITALIST' CLASS (HOW OFTEN I HAD TO LISTEN TO THAT PHRASE!); THE
FATHERLAND, BECAUSE IT WAS HELD TO BE AN INSTRUMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE
BOURGEOISIE FOR THE EXPLOITATION OF' THE WORKING MASSES; THE AUTHORITY
OF THE LAW, BECAUSE THAT WAS A MEANS OF HOLDING DOWN THE PROLETARIAT;
RELIGION, AS A MEANS OF DOPING THE PEOPLE, SO AS TO EXPLOIT THEM
AFTERWARDS; MORALITY, AS A BADGE OF STUPID AND SHEEPISH DOCILITY. THERE
WAS NOTHING THAT THEY DID NOT DRAG IN THE MUD.

AT FIRST I REMAINED SILENT; BUT THAT COULD NOT LAST VERY LONG. THEN I
BEGAN TO TAKE PART IN THE DISCUSSION AND TO REPLY TO THEIR STATEMENTS. I
HAD TO RECOGNIZE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS WAS BOUND TO BE ENTIRELY FRUITLESS,
AS LONG AS I DID NOT HAVE AT LEAST A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DEFINITE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE DISCUSSED. SO I DECIDED TO
CONSULT THE SOURCE FROM WHICH MY INTERLOCUTORS CLAIMED TO HAVE DRAWN
THEIR SO-CALLED WISDOM. I DEVOURED BOOK AFTER BOOK, PAMPHLET AFTER
PAMPHLET.

MEANWHILE, WE ARGUED WITH ONE ANOTHER ON THE BUILDING PREMISES. FROM DAY
TO DAY I WAS BECOMING BETTER INFORMED THAN MY COMPANIONS IN THE SUBJECTS
ON WHICH THEY CLAIMED TO BE EXPERTS. THEN A DAY CAME WHEN THE MORE
REDOUBTABLE OF MY ADVERSARIES RESORTED TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPON THEY
HAD TO REPLACE THE FORCE OF REASON. THIS WAS INTIMIDATION AND PHYSICAL
FORCE. SOME OF THE LEADERS AMONG MY ADVERSARIES ORDERED ME TO LEAVE THE
BUILDING OR ELSE GET FLUNG DOWN FROM THE SCAFFOLDING. AS I WAS QUITE
ALONE I COULD NOT PUT UP ANY PHYSICAL RESISTANCE; SO I CHOSE THE FIRST
ALTERNATIVE AND DEPARTED, RICHER HOWEVER BY AN EXPERIENCE.

I WENT AWAY FULL OF DISGUST; BUT AT THE SAME TIME SO DEEPLY MOVED THAT
IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TURN MY BACK ON THE WHOLE SITUATION
AND THINK NO MORE ABOUT IT. WHEN MY ANGER BEGAN TO CALM DOWN THE SPIRIT
OF OBSTINACY GOT THE UPPER HAND AND I DECIDED THAT AT ALL COSTS I WOULD
GET BACK TO WORK AGAIN IN THE BUILDING TRADE. THIS DECISION BECAME ALL
THE STRONGER A FEW WEEKS LATER, WHEN MY LITTLE SAVINGS HAD ENTIRELY RUN
OUT AND HUNGER CLUTCHED ME ONCE AGAIN IN ITS MERCILESS ARMS. NO
ALTERNATIVE WAS LEFT TO ME. I GOT WORK AGAIN AND HAD TO LEAVE IT FOR THE
SAME REASONS AS BEFORE.

THEN I ASKED MYSELF: ARE THESE MEN WORTHY OF BELONGING TO A GREAT
PEOPLE? THE QUESTION WAS PROFOUNDLY DISTURBING; FOR IF THE ANSWER WERE
'YES', THEN THE STRUGGLE TO DEFEND ONE'S NATIONALITY IS NO LONGER WORTH
ALL THE TROUBLE AND SACRIFICE WE DEMAND OF OUR BEST ELEMENTS IF IT BE IN
THE INTERESTS OF SUCH A RABBLE. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THE ANSWER HAD TO
BE 'NO--THESE MEN ARE NOT WORTHY OF THE NATION', THEN OUR NATION IS POOR
INDEED IN MEN. DURING THOSE DAYS OF MENTAL ANGUISH AND DEEP MEDITATION I
SAW BEFORE MY MIND THE EVER-INCREASING AND MENACING ARMY OF PEOPLE WHO
COULD NO LONGER BE RECKONED AS BELONGING TO THEIR OWN NATION.

IT WAS WITH QUITE A DIFFERENT FEELING, SOME DAYS LATER, THAT I GAZED ON
THE INTERMINABLE RANKS, FOUR ABREAST, OF VIENNESE WORKMEN PARADING AT A
MASS DEMONSTRATION. I STOOD DUMBFOUNDED FOR ALMOST TWO HOURS, WATCHING
THAT ENORMOUS HUMAN DRAGON WHICH SLOWLY UNCOILED ITSELF THERE BEFORE ME.
WHEN I FINALLY LEFT THE SQUARE AND WANDERED IN THE DIRECTION OF MY
LODGINGS I FELT DISMAYED AND DEPRESSED. ON MY WAY I NOTICED THE
ARBEITERZEITUNG (THE WORKMAN'S JOURNAL) IN A TOBACCO SHOP. THIS WAS THE
CHIEF PRESS-ORGAN OF THE OLD AUSTRIAN SOCIAL DEMOCRACY. IN A CHEAP CAFÃ©,
WHERE THE COMMON PEOPLE USED TO FOREGATHER AND WHERE I OFTEN WENT TO
READ THE PAPERS, THE ARBEITERZEITUNG WAS ALSO DISPLAYED. BUT HITHERTO I
COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO DO MORE THAN GLANCE AT THE WRETCHED THING FOR
A COUPLE OF MINUTES: FOR ITS WHOLE TONE WAS A SORT OF MENTAL VITRIOL TO
ME. UNDER THE DEPRESSING INFLUENCE OF THE DEMONSTRATION I HAD WITNESSED,
SOME INTERIOR VOICE URGED ME TO BUY THE PAPER IN THAT TOBACCO SHOP AND
READ IT THROUGH. SO I BROUGHT IT HOME WITH ME AND SPENT THE WHOLE
EVENING READING IT, DESPITE THE STEADILY MOUNTING RAGE PROVOKED BY THIS
CEASELESS OUTPOURING OF FALSEHOODS.

I NOW FOUND THAT IN THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC DAILY PAPERS I COULD STUDY THE
INNER CHARACTER OF THIS POLITICO-PHILOSOPHIC SYSTEM MUCH BETTER THAN IN
ALL THEIR THEORETICAL LITERATURE.

FOR THERE WAS A STRIKING DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE TWO. IN THE LITERARY
EFFUSIONS WHICH DEALT WITH THE THEORY OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY THERE WAS A
DISPLAY OF HIGH-SOUNDING PHRASEOLOGY ABOUT LIBERTY AND HUMAN DIGNITY AND
BEAUTY, ALL PROMULGATED WITH AN AIR OF PROFOUND WISDOM AND SERENE
PROPHETIC ASSURANCE; A METICULOUSLY-WOVEN GLITTER OF WORDS TO DAZZLE AND
MISLEAD THE READER. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE DAILY PRESS INCULCATED THIS
NEW DOCTRINE OF HUMAN REDEMPTION IN THE MOST BRUTAL FASHION. NO MEANS
WERE TOO BASE, PROVIDED THEY COULD BE EXPLOITED IN THE CAMPAIGN OF
SLANDER. THESE JOURNALISTS WERE REAL VIRTUOSOS IN THE ART OF TWISTING
FACTS AND PRESENTING THEM IN A DECEPTIVE FORM. THE THEORETICAL
LITERATURE WAS INTENDED FOR THE SIMPLETONS OF THE SOI-DISANT
INTELLECTUALS BELONGING TO THE MIDDLE AND, NATURALLY, THE UPPER CLASSES.
THE NEWSPAPER PROPAGANDA WAS INTENDED FOR THE MASSES.

THIS PROBING INTO BOOKS AND NEWSPAPERS AND STUDYING THE TEACHINGS OF
SOCIAL DEMOCRACY REAWAKENED MY LOVE FOR MY OWN PEOPLE. AND THUS WHAT AT
FIRST SEEMED AN IMPASSABLE CHASM BECAME THE OCCASION OF A CLOSER
AFFECTION.

HAVING ONCE UNDERSTOOD THE WORKING OF THE COLOSSAL SYSTEM FOR POISONING
THE POPULAR MIND, ONLY A FOOL COULD BLAME THE VICTIMS OF IT. DURING THE
YEARS THAT FOLLOWED I BECAME MORE INDEPENDENT AND, AS I DID SO, I BECAME
BETTER ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE INNER CAUSE OF THE SUCCESS ACHIEVED BY
THIS SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC GOSPEL. I NOW REALIZED THE MEANING AND PURPOSE OF
THOSE BRUTAL ORDERS WHICH PROHIBITED THE READING OF ALL BOOKS AND
NEWSPAPERS THAT WERE NOT 'RED' AND AT THE SAME TIME DEMANDED THAT ONLY
THE 'RED' MEETINGS SHOULD BE ATTENDED. IN THE CLEAR LIGHT OF BRUTAL
REALITY I WAS ABLE TO SEE WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE INEVITABLE
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT INTOLERANT TEACHING.

THE PSYCHE OF THE BROAD MASSES IS ACCESSIBLE ONLY TO WHAT IS STRONG AND
UNCOMPROMISING. LIKE A WOMAN WHOSE INNER SENSIBILITIES ARE NOT SO MUCH
UNDER THE SWAY OF ABSTRACT REASONING BUT ARE ALWAYS SUBJECT TO THE
INFLUENCE OF A VAGUE EMOTIONAL LONGING FOR THE STRENGTH THAT COMPLETES
HER BEING, AND WHO WOULD RATHER BOW TO THE STRONG MAN THAN DOMINATE THE
WEAKLING--IN LIKE MANNER THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE PREFER THE RULER TO
THE SUPPLIANT AND ARE FILLED WITH A STRONGER SENSE OF MENTAL SECURITY BY
A TEACHING THAT BROOKS NO RIVAL THAN BY A TEACHING WHICH OFFERS THEM A
LIBERAL CHOICE. THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE IDEA OF HOW TO MAKE SUCH A CHOICE
AND THUS THEY ARE PRONE TO FEEL THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABANDONED. THEY FEEL
VERY LITTLE SHAME AT BEING TERRORIZED INTELLECTUALLY AND THEY ARE
SCARCELY CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THEIR FREEDOM AS HUMAN BEINGS IS
IMPUDENTLY ABUSED; AND THUS THEY HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF THE
INTRINSIC FALLACY OF THE WHOLE DOCTRINE. THEY SEE ONLY THE RUTHLESS
FORCE AND BRUTALITY OF ITS DETERMINED UTTERANCES, TO WHICH THEY ALWAYS
SUBMIT.

IF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY SHOULD BE OPPOSED BY A MORE TRUTHFUL TEACHING, THEN
EVEN, THOUGH THE STRUGGLE BE OF THE BITTEREST KIND, THIS TRUTHFUL
TEACHING WILL FINALLY PREVAIL PROVIDED IT BE ENFORCED WITH EQUAL
RUTHLESSNESS.

WITHIN LESS THAN TWO YEARS I HAD GAINED A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIAL
DEMOCRACY, IN ITS TEACHING AND THE TECHNIQUE OF ITS OPERATIONS.

I RECOGNIZED THE INFAMY OF THAT TECHNIQUE WHEREBY THE MOVEMENT CARRIED
ON A CAMPAIGN OF MENTAL TERRORISM AGAINST THE BOURGEOISIE, WHO ARE
NEITHER MORALLY NOR SPIRITUALLY EQUIPPED TO WITHSTAND SUCH ATTACKS. THE
TACTICS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY CONSISTED IN OPENING, AT A GIVEN SIGNAL, A
VERITABLE DRUM-FIRE OF LIES AND CALUMNIES AGAINST THE MAN WHOM THEY
BELIEVED TO BE THE MOST REDOUBTABLE OF THEIR ADVERSARIES, UNTIL THE
NERVES OF THE LATTER GAVE WAY AND THEY SACRIFICED THE MAN WHO WAS
ATTACKED, SIMPLY IN THE HOPE OF BEING ALLOWED TO LIVE IN PEACE. BUT THE
HOPE PROVED ALWAYS TO BE A FOOLISH ONE, FOR THEY WERE NEVER LEFT IN
PEACE.

THE SAME TACTICS ARE REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN, UNTIL FEAR OF THESE MAD
DOGS EXERCISES, THROUGH SUGGESTION, A PARALYSING EFFECT ON THEIR
VICTIMS.

THROUGH ITS OWN EXPERIENCE SOCIAL DEMOCRACY LEARNED THE VALUE OF
STRENGTH, AND FOR THAT REASON IT ATTACKS MOSTLY THOSE IN WHOM IT SCENTS
STUFF OF THE MORE STALWART KIND, WHICH IS INDEED A VERY RARE POSSESSION.
ON THE OTHER HAND IT PRAISES EVERY WEAKLING AMONG ITS ADVERSARIES, MORE
OR LESS CAUTIOUSLY, ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE OF HIS MENTAL QUALITIES
KNOWN OR PRESUMED. THEY HAVE LESS FEAR OF A MAN OF GENIUS WHO LACKS
WILL-POWER THAN OF A VIGOROUS CHARACTER WITH MEDIOCRE INTELLIGENCE AND
AT THE SAME TIME THEY HIGHLY COMMEND THOSE WHO ARE DEVOID OF
INTELLIGENCE AND WILL-POWER.

THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS KNOW HOW TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY ALONE
ARE THE PROTECTORS OF PEACE. IN THIS WAY, ACTING VERY CIRCUMSPECTLY BUT
NEVER LOSING SIGHT OF THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL, THEY CONQUER ONE POSITION
AFTER ANOTHER, AT ONE TIME BY METHODS OF QUIET INTIMIDATION AND AT
ANOTHER TIME BY SHEER DAYLIGHT ROBBERY, EMPLOYING THESE LATTER TACTICS
AT THOSE MOMENTS WHEN PUBLIC ATTENTION IS TURNED TOWARDS OTHER MATTERS
FROM WHICH IT DOES NOT WISH TO BE DIVERTED, OR WHEN THE PUBLIC CONSIDERS
AN INCIDENT TOO TRIVIAL TO CREATE A SCANDAL ABOUT IT AND THUS PROVOKE
THE ANGER OF A MALIGNANT OPPONENT.

THESE TACTICS ARE BASED ON AN ACCURATE ESTIMATION OF HUMAN FRAILTIES AND
MUST LEAD TO SUCCESS, WITH ALMOST MATHEMATICAL CERTAINTY, UNLESS THE
OTHER SIDE ALSO LEARNS HOW TO FIGHT POISON GAS WITH POISON GAS. THE
WEAKER NATURES MUST BE TOLD THAT HERE IT IS A CASE OF TO BE OR NOT TO
BE.

I ALSO CAME TO UNDERSTAND THAT PHYSICAL INTIMIDATION HAS ITS
SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE MASS AS WELL AS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL. HERE AGAIN THE
SOCIALISTS HAD CALCULATED ACCURATELY ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT.

INTIMIDATION IN WORKSHOPS AND IN FACTORIES, IN ASSEMBLY HALLS AND AT
MASS DEMONSTRATIONS, WILL ALWAYS MEET WITH SUCCESS AS LONG AS IT DOES
NOT HAVE TO ENCOUNTER THE SAME KIND OF TERROR IN A STRONGER FORM.

THEN OF COURSE THE PARTY WILL RAISE A HORRIFIED OUTCRY, YELLING BLUE
MURDER AND APPEALING TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE, WHICH THEY HAVE JUST
REPUDIATED. IN DOING THIS THEIR AIM GENERALLY IS TO ADD TO THE GENERAL
CONFUSION, SO THAT THEY MAY HAVE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY OF REACHING THEIR
OWN GOAL UNOBSERVED. THEIR IDEA IS TO FIND AMONG THE HIGHER GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS SOME BOVINE CREATURE WHO, IN THE STUPID HOPE THAT HE MAY WIN
THE GOOD GRACES OF THESE AWE-INSPIRING OPPONENTS SO THAT THEY MAY
REMEMBER HIM IN CASE OF FUTURE EVENTUALITIES, WILL HELP THEM NOW TO
BREAK ALL THOSE WHO MAY OPPOSE THIS WORLD PEST.

THE IMPRESSION WHICH SUCH SUCCESSFUL TACTICS MAKE ON THE MINDS OF THE
BROAD MASSES, WHETHER THEY BE ADHERENTS OR OPPONENTS, CAN BE ESTIMATED
ONLY BY ONE WHO KNOWS THE POPULAR MIND, NOT FROM BOOKS BUT FROM
PRACTICAL LIFE. FOR THE SUCCESSES WHICH ARE THUS OBTAINED ARE TAKEN BY
THE ADHERENTS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY AS A TRIUMPHANT SYMBOL OF THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THEIR OWN CAUSE; ON THE OTHER HAND THE BEATEN OPPONENT
VERY OFTEN LOSES FAITH IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY FURTHER RESISTANCE.

THE MORE I UNDERSTOOD THE METHODS OF PHYSICAL INTIMIDATION THAT WERE
EMPLOYED, THE MORE SYMPATHY I HAD FOR THE MULTITUDE THAT HAD SUCCUMBED
TO IT.

I AM THANKFUL NOW FOR THE ORDEAL WHICH I HAD TO GO THROUGH AT THAT TIME;
FOR IT WAS THE MEANS OF BRINGING ME TO THINK KINDLY AGAIN OF MY OWN
PEOPLE, INASMUCH AS THE EXPERIENCE ENABLED ME TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE
FALSE LEADERS AND THE VICTIMS WHO HAVE BEEN LED ASTRAY.

WE MUST LOOK UPON THE LATTER SIMPLY AS VICTIMS. I HAVE JUST NOW TRIED TO
DEPICT A FEW TRAITS WHICH EXPRESS THE MENTALITY OF THOSE ON THE LOWEST
RUNG OF THE SOCIAL LADDER; BUT MY PICTURE WOULD BE DISPROPORTIONATE IF I
DO NOT ADD THAT AMID THE SOCIAL DEPTHS I STILL FOUND LIGHT; FOR I
EXPERIENCED A RARE SPIRIT OF SELF-SACRIFICE AND LOYAL COMRADESHIP AMONG
THOSE MEN, WHO DEMANDED LITTLE FROM LIFE AND WERE CONTENT AMID THEIR
MODEST SURROUNDINGS. THIS WAS TRUE ESPECIALLY OF THE OLDER GENERATION OF
WORKMEN. AND ALTHOUGH THESE QUALITIES WERE DISAPPEARING MORE AND MORE IN
THE YOUNGER GENERATION, OWING TO THE ALL-PERVADING INFLUENCE OF THE BIG
CITY, YET AMONG THE YOUNGER GENERATION ALSO THERE WERE MANY WHO WERE
SOUND AT THE CORE AND WHO WERE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEMSELVES
UNCONTAMINATED AMID THE SORDID SURROUNDINGS OF THEIR EVERYDAY EXISTENCE.
IF THESE MEN, WHO IN MANY CASES MEANT WELL AND WERE UPRIGHT IN
THEMSELVES, GAVE THE SUPPORT TO THE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES CARRIED ON BY
THE COMMON ENEMIES OF OUR PEOPLE, THAT WAS BECAUSE THOSE DECENT
WORKPEOPLE DID NOT AND COULD NOT GRASP THE DOWNRIGHT INFAMY OF THE
DOCTRINE TAUGHT BY THE SOCIALIST AGITATORS. FURTHERMORE, IT WAS BECAUSE
NO OTHER SECTION OF THE COMMUNITY BOTHERED ITSELF ABOUT THE LOT OF THE
WORKING CLASSES. FINALLY, THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS BECAME SUCH THAT MEN WHO
OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE ACTED DIFFERENTLY WERE FORCED TO SUBMIT TO THEM,
EVEN THOUGH UNWILLINGLY AT FIRST. A DAY CAME WHEN POVERTY GAINED THE
UPPER HAND AND DROVE THOSE WORKMEN INTO THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC RANKS.

ON INNUMERABLE OCCASIONS THE BOURGEOISIE TOOK A DEFINITE STAND AGAINST
EVEN THE MOST LEGITIMATE HUMAN DEMANDS OF THE WORKING CLASSES. THAT
CONDUCT WAS ILL-JUDGED AND INDEED IMMORAL AND COULD BRING NO GAIN
WHATSOEVER TO THE BOURGEOIS CLASS. THE RESULT WAS THAT THE HONEST
WORKMAN ABANDONED THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT OF THE TRADES UNION ORGANIZATION
AND WAS DRAGGED INTO POLITICS.

THERE WERE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF WORKMEN WHO BEGAN BY BEING HOSTILE
TO THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY; BUT THEIR DEFENCES WERE REPEATEDLY
STORMED AND FINALLY THEY HAD TO SURRENDER. YET THIS DEFEAT WAS DUE TO
THE STUPIDITY OF THE BOURGEOIS PARTIES, WHO HAD OPPOSED EVERY SOCIAL
DEMAND PUT FORWARD BY THE WORKING CLASS. THE SHORT-SIGHTED REFUSAL TO
MAKE AN EFFORT TOWARDS IMPROVING LABOUR CONDITIONS, THE REFUSAL TO ADOPT
MEASURES WHICH WOULD INSURE THE WORKMAN IN CASE OF ACCIDENTS IN THE
FACTORIES, THE REFUSAL TO FORBID CHILD LABOUR, THE REFUSAL TO CONSIDER
PROTECTIVE MEASURES FOR FEMALE WORKERS, ESPECIALLY EXPECTANT
MOTHERS--ALL THIS WAS OF ASSISTANCE TO THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADERS,
WHO WERE THANKFUL FOR EVERY OPPORTUNITY WHICH THEY COULD EXPLOIT FOR
FORCING THE MASSES INTO THEIR NET. OUR BOURGEOIS PARTIES CAN NEVER
REPAIR THE DAMAGE THAT RESULTED FROM THE MISTAKE THEY THEN MADE. FOR
THEY SOWED THE SEEDS OF HATRED WHEN THEY OPPOSED ALL EFFORTS AT SOCIAL
REFORM. AND THUS THEY GAVE, AT LEAST, APPARENT GROUNDS TO JUSTIFY THE
CLAIM PUT FORWARD BY THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS--NAMELY, THAT THEY ALONE STAND
UP FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE WORKING CLASS.

AND THIS BECAME THE PRINCIPAL GROUND FOR THE MORAL JUSTIFICATION OF THE
ACTUAL EXISTENCE OF THE TRADES UNIONS, SO THAT THE LABOUR ORGANIZATION
BECAME FROM THAT TIME ONWARDS THE CHIEF POLITICAL RECRUITING GROUND TO
SWELL THE RANKS OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

WHILE THUS STUDYING THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS AROUND ME I WAS FORCED,
WHETHER I LIKED IT OR NOT, TO DECIDE ON THE ATTITUDE I SHOULD TAKE
TOWARDS THE TRADES UNIONS. BECAUSE I LOOKED UPON THEM AS INSEPARABLE
FROM THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, MY DECISION WAS HASTY--AND MISTAKEN. I
REPUDIATED THEM AS A MATTER OF COURSE. BUT ON THIS ESSENTIAL QUESTION
ALSO FATE INTERVENED AND GAVE ME A LESSON, WITH THE RESULT THAT I
CHANGED THE OPINION WHICH I HAD FIRST FORMED.

WHEN I WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD I HAD LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE
TRADES UNION AS A MEANS OF DEFENDING THE SOCIAL RIGHTS OF THE EMPLOYEES
AND FIGHTING FOR BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS FOR THEM AND, ON THE OTHER
HAND, THE TRADES UNION AS A POLITICAL INSTRUMENT USED BY THE PARTY IN
THE CLASS STRUGGLE.

THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS UNDERSTOOD THE ENORMOUS IMPORTANCE OF THE TRADES
UNION MOVEMENT. THEY APPROPRIATED IT AS AN INSTRUMENT AND USED IT WITH
SUCCESS, WHILE THE BOURGEOIS PARTIES FAILED TO UNDERSTAND IT AND THUS
LOST THEIR POLITICAL PRESTIGE. THEY THOUGHT THAT THEIR OWN ARROGANT VETO
WOULD ARREST THE LOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE MOVEMENT AND FORCE IT INTO
AN ILLOGICAL POSITION. BUT IT IS ABSURD AND ALSO UNTRUE TO SAY THAT THE
TRADES UNION MOVEMENT IS IN ITSELF HOSTILE TO THE NATION. THE OPPOSITE
IS THE MORE CORRECT VIEW. IF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE TRADES UNION ARE
DIRECTED TOWARDS IMPROVING THE CONDITION OF A CLASS, AND SUCCEED IN
DOING SO, SUCH ACTIVITIES ARE NOT AGAINST THE FATHERLAND OR THE STATE
BUT ARE, IN THE TRUEST SENSE OF THE WORD, NATIONAL. IN THAT WAY THE
TRADES UNION ORGANIZATION HELPS TO CREATE THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS WHICH
ARE INDISPENSABLE IN A GENERAL SYSTEM OF NATIONAL EDUCATION. IT DESERVES
HIGH RECOGNITION WHEN IT DESTROYS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL GERMS
OF SOCIAL DISEASE AND THUS FOSTERS THE GENERAL WELFARE OF THE NATION.

IT IS SUPERFLUOUS TO ASK WHETHER THE TRADES UNION IS INDISPENSABLE.

SO LONG AS THERE ARE EMPLOYERS WHO ATTACK SOCIAL UNDERSTANDING AND HAVE
WRONG IDEAS OF JUSTICE AND FAIR PLAY IT IS NOT ONLY THE RIGHT BUT ALSO
THE DUTY OF THEIR EMPLOYEES--WHO ARE, AFTER ALL, AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR
PEOPLE--TO PROTECT THE GENERAL INTERESTS AGAINST THE GREED AND UNREASON
OF THE INDIVIDUAL. FOR TO SAFEGUARD THE LOYALTY AND CONFIDENCE OF THE
PEOPLE IS AS MUCH IN THE INTERESTS OF THE NATION AS TO SAFEGUARD PUBLIC
HEALTH.

BOTH ARE SERIOUSLY MENACED BY DISHONOURABLE EMPLOYERS WHO ARE NOT
CONSCIOUS OF THEIR DUTY AS MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COMMUNITY. THEIR
PERSONAL AVIDITY OR IRRESPONSIBILITY SOWS THE SEEDS OF FUTURE TROUBLE.
TO ELIMINATE THE CAUSES OF SUCH A DEVELOPMENT IS AN ACTION THAT SURELY
DESERVES WELL OF THE COUNTRY.

IT MUST NOT BE ANSWERED HERE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WORKMAN IS FREE AT ANY
TIME TO ESCAPE FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN INJUSTICE WHICH HE HAS
ACTUALLY SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF AN EMPLOYER, OR WHICH HE THINKS HE HAS
SUFFERED--IN OTHER WORDS, HE CAN LEAVE. NO. THAT ARGUMENT IS ONLY A RUSE
TO DETRACT ATTENTION FROM THE QUESTION AT ISSUE. IS IT, OR IS IT NOT, IN
THE INTERESTS OF THE NATION TO REMOVE THE CAUSES OF SOCIAL UNREST? IF IT
IS, THEN THE FIGHT MUST BE CARRIED ON WITH THE ONLY WEAPONS THAT PROMISE
SUCCESS. BUT THE INDIVIDUAL WORKMAN IS NEVER IN A POSITION TO STAND UP
AGAINST THE MIGHT OF THE BIG EMPLOYER; FOR THE QUESTION HERE IS NOT ONE
THAT CONCERNS THE TRIUMPH OF RIGHT. IF IN SUCH A RELATION RIGHT HAD BEEN
RECOGNIZED AS THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE, THEN THE CONFLICT COULD NOT HAVE
ARISEN AT ALL. BUT HERE IT IS A QUESTION OF WHO IS THE STRONGER. IF THE
CASE WERE OTHERWISE, THE SENTIMENT OF JUSTICE ALONE WOULD SOLVE THE
DISPUTE IN AN HONOURABLE WAY; OR, TO PUT THE CASE MORE CORRECTLY,
MATTERS WOULD NOT HAVE COME TO SUCH A DISPUTE AT ALL.

NO. IF UNSOCIAL AND DISHONOURABLE TREATMENT OF MEN PROVOKES RESISTANCE,
THEN THE STRONGER PARTY CAN IMPOSE ITS DECISION IN THE CONFLICT UNTIL
THE CONSTITUTIONAL LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITIES DO AWAY WITH THE EVIL THROUGH
LEGISLATION. THEREFORE IT IS EVIDENT THAT IF THE INDIVIDUAL WORKMAN IS
TO HAVE ANY CHANCE AT ALL OF WINNING THROUGH IN THE STRUGGLE HE MUST BE
GROUPED WITH HIS FELLOW WORKMEN AND PRESENT A UNITED FRONT BEFORE THE
INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYER, WHO INCORPORATES IN HIS OWN PERSON THE MASSED
STRENGTH OF THE VESTED INTERESTS IN THE INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL
UNDERTAKING WHICH HE CONDUCTS.

THUS THE TRADES UNIONS CAN HOPE TO INCULCATE AND STRENGTHEN A SENSE OF
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN WORKADAY LIFE AND OPEN THE ROAD TO PRACTICAL
RESULTS. IN DOING THIS THEY TEND TO REMOVE THOSE CAUSES OF FRICTION
WHICH ARE A CONTINUAL SOURCE OF DISCONTENT AND COMPLAINT.

BLAME FOR THE FACT THAT THE TRADES UNIONS DO NOT FULFIL THIS
MUCH-DESIRED FUNCTION MUST BE LAID AT THE DOORS OF THOSE WHO BARRED THE
ROAD TO LEGISLATIVE SOCIAL REFORM, OR RENDERED SUCH A REFORM INEFFECTIVE
BY SABOTAGING IT THROUGH THEIR POLITICAL INFLUENCE.

THE POLITICAL BOURGEOISIE FAILED TO UNDERSTAND--OR, RATHER, THEY DID NOT
WISH TO UNDERSTAND--THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TRADES UNION MOVEMENT. THE
SOCIAL DEMOCRATS ACCORDINGLY SEIZED THE ADVANTAGE OFFERED THEM BY THIS
MISTAKEN POLICY AND TOOK THE LABOUR MOVEMENT UNDER THEIR EXCLUSIVE
PROTECTION, WITHOUT ANY PROTEST FROM THE OTHER SIDE. IN THIS WAY THEY
ESTABLISHED FOR THEMSELVES A SOLID BULWARK BEHIND WHICH THEY COULD
SAFELY RETIRE WHENEVER THE STRUGGLE ASSUMED A CRITICAL ASPECT. THUS THE
GENUINE PURPOSE OF THE MOVEMENT GRADUALLY FELL INTO OBLIVION, AND WAS
REPLACED BY NEW OBJECTIVES. FOR THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS NEVER TROUBLED
THEMSELVES TO RESPECT AND UPHOLD THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE
TRADE UNIONIST MOVEMENT WAS FOUNDED. THEY SIMPLY TOOK OVER THE MOVEMENT,
LOCK, STOCK AND BARREL, TO SERVE THEIR OWN POLITICAL ENDS.

WITHIN A FEW DECADES THE TRADES UNION MOVEMENT WAS TRANSFORMED, BY THE
EXPERT HAND OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY, FROM AN INSTRUMENT WHICH HAD BEEN
ORIGINALLY FASHIONED FOR THE DEFENCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS INTO AN INSTRUMENT
FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC STRUCTURE. THE INTERESTS OF
THE WORKING CLASS WERE NOT ALLOWED FOR A MOMENT TO CROSS THE PATH OF
THIS PURPOSE; FOR IN POLITICS THE APPLICATION OF ECONOMIC PRESSURE IS
ALWAYS POSSIBLE IF THE ONE SIDE BE SUFFICIENTLY UNSCRUPULOUS AND THE
OTHER SUFFICIENTLY INERT AND DOCILE. IN THIS CASE BOTH CONDITIONS WERE
FULFILLED.

BY THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENT CENTURY THE TRADES UNIONIST MOVEMENT HAD
ALREADY CEASED TO RECOGNIZE THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT HAD BEEN FOUNDED.
FROM YEAR TO YEAR IT FELL MORE AND MORE UNDER THE POLITICAL CONTROL OF
THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS, UNTIL IT FINALLY CAME TO BE USED AS A
BATTERING-RAM IN THE CLASS STRUGGLE. THE PLAN WAS TO SHATTER, BY MEANS
OF CONSTANTLY REPEATED BLOWS, THE ECONOMIC EDIFICE IN THE BUILDING OF
WHICH SO MUCH TIME AND CARE HAD BEEN EXPENDED. ONCE THIS OBJECTIVE HAD
BEEN REACHED, THE DESTRUCTION OF THE STATE WOULD BECOME A MATTER OF
COURSE, BECAUSE THE STATE WOULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF ITS
ECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS. ATTENTION TO THE REAL INTERESTS OF THE
WORKING-CLASSES, ON THE PART OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS, STEADILY DECREASED
UNTIL THE CUNNING LEADERS SAW THAT IT WOULD BE IN THEIR IMMEDIATE
POLITICAL INTERESTS IF THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL DEMANDS OF THE BROAD
MASSES REMAINED UNHEEDED; FOR THERE WAS A DANGER THAT IF THESE MASSES
ONCE FELT CONTENT THEY COULD NO LONGER BE EMPLOYED AS MERE PASSIVE
MATERIAL IN THE POLITICAL STRUGGLE.

THE GLOOMY PROSPECT WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF TO THE EYES OF THE
CONDOTTIERI OF THE CLASS WARFARE, IF THE DISCONTENT OF THE MASSES WERE
NO LONGER AVAILABLE AS A WAR WEAPON, CREATED SO MUCH ANXIETY AMONG THEM
THAT THEY SUPPRESSED AND OPPOSED EVEN THE MOST ELEMENTARY MEASURES OF
SOCIAL REFORM. AND CONDITIONS WERE SUCH THAT THOSE LEADERS DID NOT HAVE
TO TROUBLE ABOUT ATTEMPTING TO JUSTIFY SUCH AN ILLOGICAL POLICY.

AS THE MASSES WERE TAUGHT TO INCREASE AND HEIGHTEN THEIR DEMANDS THE
POSSIBILITY OF SATISFYING THEM DWINDLED AND WHATEVER AMELIORATIVE
MEASURES WERE TAKEN BECAME LESS AND LESS SIGNIFICANT; SO THAT IT WAS AT
THAT TIME POSSIBLE TO PERSUADE THE MASSES THAT THIS RIDICULOUS MEASURE
IN WHICH THE MOST SACRED CLAIMS OF THE WORKING-CLASSES WERE BEING
GRANTED REPRESENTED A DIABOLICAL PLAN TO WEAKEN THEIR FIGHTING POWER IN
THIS EASY WAY AND, IF POSSIBLE, TO PARALYSE IT. ONE WILL NOT BE
ASTONISHED AT THE SUCCESS OF THESE ALLEGATIONS IF ONE REMEMBERS WHAT A
SMALL MEASURE OF THINKING POWER THE BROAD MASSES POSSESS.

IN THE BOURGEOIS CAMP THERE WAS HIGH INDIGNATION OVER THE BAD FAITH OF
THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC TACTICS; BUT NOTHING WAS DONE TO DRAW A PRACTICAL
CONCLUSION AND ORGANIZE A COUNTER ATTACK FROM THE BOURGEOIS SIDE. THE
FEAR OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS, TO IMPROVE THE MISERABLE CONDITIONS OF THE
WORKING-CLASSES OUGHT TO HAVE INDUCED THE BOURGEOIS PARTIES TO MAKE THE
MOST ENERGETIC EFFORTS IN THIS DIRECTION AND THUS SNATCH FROM THE HANDS
OF THE CLASS-WARFARE LEADERS THEIR MOST IMPORTANT WEAPON; BUT NOTHING OF
THIS KIND HAPPENED.

INSTEAD OF ATTACKING THE POSITION OF THEIR ADVERSARIES THE BOURGEOISIE
ALLOWED ITSELF TO BE PRESSED AND HARRIED. FINALLY IT ADOPTED MEANS THAT
WERE SO TARDY AND SO INSIGNIFICANT THAT THEY WERE INEFFECTIVE AND WERE
REPUDIATED. SO THE WHOLE SITUATION REMAINED JUST AS IT HAD BEEN BEFORE
THE BOURGEOIS INTERVENTION; BUT THE DISCONTENT HAD THEREBY BECOME MORE
SERIOUS.

LIKE A THREATENING STORM, THE 'FREE TRADES UNION' HOVERED ABOVE THE
POLITICAL HORIZON AND ABOVE THE LIFE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL. IT WAS ONE OF
THE MOST FRIGHTFUL INSTRUMENTS OF TERROR THAT THREATENED THE SECURITY
AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC STRUCTURE, THE FOUNDATIONS OF
THE STATE AND THE LIBERTY OF THE INDIVIDUAL. ABOVE ALL, IT WAS THE 'FREE
TRADES UNION' THAT TURNED DEMOCRACY INTO A RIDICULOUS AND SCORNED
PHRASE, INSULTED THE IDEAL OF LIBERTY AND STIGMATIZED THAT OF FRATERNITY
WITH THE SLOGAN 'IF YOU WILL NOT BECOME OUR COMRADE WE SHALL CRACK YOUR
SKULL'.

IT WAS THUS THAT I THEN CAME TO KNOW THIS FRIEND OF HUMANITY. DURING THE
YEARS THAT FOLLOWED MY KNOWLEDGE OF IT BECAME WIDER AND DEEPER; BUT I
HAVE NEVER CHANGED ANYTHING IN THAT REGARD.

THE MORE I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH THE EXTERNAL FORMS OF SOCIAL
DEMOCRACY, THE GREATER BECAME MY DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND THE INNER NATURE
OF ITS DOCTRINES.

FOR THIS PURPOSE THE OFFICIAL LITERATURE OF THE PARTY COULD NOT HELP
VERY MUCH. IN DISCUSSING ECONOMIC QUESTIONS ITS STATEMENTS WERE FALSE
AND ITS PROOFS UNSOUND. IN TREATING OF POLITICAL AIMS ITS ATTITUDE WAS
INSINCERE. FURTHERMORE, ITS MODERN METHODS OF CHICANERY IN THE
PRESENTATION OF ITS ARGUMENTS WERE PROFOUNDLY REPUGNANT TO ME. ITS
FLAMBOYANT SENTENCES, ITS OBSCURE AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE PHRASES,
PRETENDED TO CONTAIN GREAT THOUGHTS, BUT THEY WERE DEVOID OF THOUGHT,
AND MEANINGLESS. ONE WOULD HAVE TO BE A DECADENT BOHEMIAN IN ONE OF OUR
MODERN CITIES IN ORDER TO FEEL AT HOME IN THAT LABYRINTH OF MENTAL
ABERRATION, SO THAT HE MIGHT DISCOVER 'INTIMATE EXPERIENCES' AMID THE
STINKING FUMES OF THIS LITERARY DADISM. THESE WRITERS WERE OBVIOUSLY
COUNTING ON THE PROVERBIAL HUMILITY OF A CERTAIN SECTION OF OUR PEOPLE,
WHO BELIEVE THAT A PERSON WHO IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE MUST BE PROFOUNDLY
WISE.

IN CONFRONTING THE THEORETICAL FALSITY AND ABSURDITY OF THAT DOCTRINE
WITH THE REALITY OF ITS EXTERNAL MANIFESTATIONS, I GRADUALLY CAME TO
HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF THE ENDS AT WHICH IT AIMED.

DURING SUCH MOMENTS I HAD DARK PRESENTIMENTS AND FEARED SOMETHING EVIL.
I HAD BEFORE ME A TEACHING INSPIRED BY EGOISM AND HATRED, MATHEMATICALLY
CALCULATED TO WIN ITS VICTORY, BUT THE TRIUMPH OF WHICH WOULD BE A
MORTAL BLOW TO HUMANITY.

MEANWHILE I HAD DISCOVERED THE RELATIONS EXISTING BETWEEN THIS
DESTRUCTIVE TEACHING AND THE SPECIFIC CHARACTER OF A PEOPLE, WHO UP TO
THAT TIME HAD BEEN TO ME ALMOST UNKNOWN.

KNOWLEDGE OF THE JEWS IS THE ONLY KEY WHEREBY ONE MAY UNDERSTAND THE
INNER NATURE AND THEREFORE THE REAL AIMS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY.

THE MAN WHO HAS COME TO KNOW THIS RACE HAS SUCCEEDED IN REMOVING FROM
HIS EYES THE VEIL THROUGH WHICH HE HAD SEEN THE AIMS AND MEANING OF HIS
PARTY IN A FALSE LIGHT; AND THEN, OUT OF THE MURK AND FOG OF SOCIAL
PHRASES RISES THE GRIMACING FIGURE OF MARXISM.

TO-DAY IT IS HARD AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY WHEN THE WORD
'JEW' FIRST BEGAN TO RAISE ANY PARTICULAR THOUGHT IN MY MIND. I DO NOT
REMEMBER EVEN HAVING HEARD THE WORD AT HOME DURING MY FATHER'S LIFETIME.
IF THIS NAME WERE MENTIONED IN A DEROGATORY SENSE I THINK THE OLD
GENTLEMAN WOULD JUST HAVE CONSIDERED THOSE WHO USED IT IN THIS WAY AS
BEING UNEDUCATED REACTIONARIES. IN THE COURSE OF HIS CAREER HE HAD COME
TO BE MORE OR LESS A COSMOPOLITAN, WITH STRONG VIEWS ON NATIONALISM,
WHICH HAD ITS EFFECT ON ME AS WELL. IN SCHOOL, TOO, I FOUND NO REASON TO
ALTER THE PICTURE OF THINGS I HAD FORMED AT HOME.

AT THE REALSCHULE I KNEW ONE JEWISH BOY. WE WERE ALL ON OUR GUARD IN OUR
RELATIONS WITH HIM, BUT ONLY BECAUSE HIS RETICENCE AND CERTAIN ACTIONS
OF HIS WARNED US TO BE DISCREET. BEYOND THAT MY COMPANIONS AND MYSELF
FORMED NO PARTICULAR OPINIONS IN REGARD TO HIM.

IT WAS NOT UNTIL I WAS FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS OLD THAT I FREQUENTLY
RAN UP AGAINST THE WORD 'JEW', PARTLY IN CONNECTION WITH POLITICAL
CONTROVERSIES. THESE REFERENCES AROUSED A SLIGHT AVERSION IN ME, AND I
COULD NOT AVOID AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING WHICH ALWAYS CAME OVER ME WHEN
I HAD TO LISTEN TO RELIGIOUS DISPUTES. BUT AT THAT TIME I HAD NO OTHER
FEELINGS ABOUT THE JEWISH QUESTION.

THERE WERE VERY FEW JEWS IN LINZ. IN THE COURSE OF CENTURIES THE JEWS
WHO LIVED THERE HAD BECOME EUROPEANIZED IN EXTERNAL APPEARANCE AND WERE
SO MUCH LIKE OTHER HUMAN BEINGS THAT I EVEN LOOKED UPON THEM AS GERMANS.
THE REASON WHY I DID NOT THEN PERCEIVE THE ABSURDITY OF SUCH AN ILLUSION
WAS THAT THE ONLY EXTERNAL MARK WHICH I RECOGNIZED AS DISTINGUISHING
THEM FROM US WAS THE PRACTICE OF THEIR STRANGE RELIGION. AS I THOUGHT
THAT THEY WERE PERSECUTED ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR FAITH MY AVERSION TO
HEARING REMARKS AGAINST THEM GREW ALMOST INTO A FEELING OF ABHORRENCE. I
DID NOT IN THE LEAST SUSPECT THAT THERE COULD BE SUCH A THING AS A
SYSTEMATIC ANTI-SEMITISM.

THEN I CAME TO VIENNA.

CONFUSED BY THE MASS OF IMPRESSIONS I RECEIVED FROM THE ARCHITECTURAL
SURROUNDINGS AND DEPRESSED BY MY OWN TROUBLES, I DID NOT AT FIRST
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SOCIAL STRATA OF WHICH THE POPULATION
OF THAT MAMMOTH CITY WAS COMPOSED. ALTHOUGH VIENNA THEN HAD ABOUT TWO
HUNDRED THOUSAND JEWS AMONG ITS POPULATION OF TWO MILLIONS, I DID NOT
NOTICE THEM. DURING THE FIRST WEEKS OF MY SOJOURN MY EYES AND MY MIND
WERE UNABLE TO COPE WITH THE ONRUSH OF NEW IDEAS AND VALUES. NOT UNTIL I
GRADUALLY SETTLED DOWN TO MY SURROUNDINGS, AND THE CONFUSED PICTURE
BEGAN TO GROW CLEARER, DID I ACQUIRE A MORE DISCRIMINATING VIEW OF MY
NEW WORLD. AND WITH THAT I CAME UP AGAINST THE JEWISH PROBLEM.

I WILL NOT SAY THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH I FIRST BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH
IT WAS PARTICULARLY UNPLEASANT FOR ME. IN THE JEW I STILL SAW ONLY A MAN
WHO WAS OF A DIFFERENT RELIGION, AND THEREFORE, ON GROUNDS OF HUMAN
TOLERANCE, I WAS AGAINST THE IDEA THAT HE SHOULD BE ATTACKED BECAUSE HE
HAD A DIFFERENT FAITH. AND SO I CONSIDERED THAT THE TONE ADOPTED BY THE
ANTI-SEMITIC PRESS IN VIENNA WAS UNWORTHY OF THE CULTURAL TRADITIONS OF
A GREAT PEOPLE. THE MEMORY OF CERTAIN EVENTS WHICH HAPPENED IN THE
MIDDLE AGES CAME INTO MY MIND, AND I FELT THAT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE
THEM REPEATED. GENERALLY SPEAKING, THESE ANTI-SEMITIC NEWSPAPERS DID NOT
BELONG TO THE FIRST RANK--BUT I DID NOT THEN UNDERSTAND THE REASON OF
THIS--AND SO I REGARDED THEM MORE AS THE PRODUCTS OF JEALOUSY AND ENVY
RATHER THAN THE EXPRESSION OF A SINCERE, THOUGH WRONG-HEADED, FEELING.

MY OWN OPINIONS WERE CONFIRMED BY WHAT I CONSIDERED TO BE THE INFINITELY
MORE DIGNIFIED MANNER IN WHICH THE REALLY GREAT PRESS REPLIED TO THOSE
ATTACKS OR SIMPLY IGNORED THEM, WHICH LATTER SEEMED TO ME THE MOST
RESPECTABLE WAY.

I DILIGENTLY READ WHAT WAS GENERALLY CALLED THE WORLD PRESS--NEUE FREIE
PRESSE, WIENER TAGEBLATT, ETC.--AND I WAS ASTONISHED BY THE ABUNDANCE OF
INFORMATION THEY GAVE THEIR READERS AND THE IMPARTIAL WAY IN WHICH THEY
PRESENTED PARTICULAR PROBLEMS. I APPRECIATED THEIR DIGNIFIED TONE; BUT
SOMETIMES THE FLAMBOYANCY OF THE STYLE WAS UNCONVINCING, AND I DID NOT
LIKE IT. BUT I ATTRIBUTED ALL THIS TO THE OVERPOWERING INFLUENCE OF THE
WORLD METROPOLIS.

SINCE I CONSIDERED VIENNA AT THAT TIME AS SUCH A WORLD METROPOLIS, I
THOUGHT THIS CONSTITUTED SUFFICIENT GROUNDS TO EXCUSE THESE SHORTCOMINGS
OF THE PRESS. BUT I WAS FREQUENTLY DISGUSTED BY THE GROVELLING WAY IN
WHICH THE VIENNA PRESS PLAYED LACKEY TO THE COURT. SCARCELY A MOVE TOOK
PLACE AT THE HOFBURG WHICH WAS NOT PRESENTED IN GLORIFIED COLOURS TO THE
READERS. IT WAS A FOOLISH PRACTICE, WHICH, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT HAD TO DO
WITH 'THE WISEST MONARCH OF ALL TIMES', REMINDED ONE ALMOST OF THE DANCE
WHICH THE MOUNTAIN COCK PERFORMS AT PAIRING TIME TO WOO HIS MATE. IT WAS
ALL EMPTY NONSENSE. AND I THOUGHT THAT SUCH A POLICY WAS A STAIN ON THE
IDEAL OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAY OF CURRYING FAVOUR
AT THE COURT WAS UNWORTHY OF THE PEOPLE. AND THAT WAS THE FIRST BLOT
THAT FELL ON MY APPRECIATION OF THE GREAT VIENNA PRESS.

WHILE IN VIENNA I CONTINUED TO FOLLOW WITH A VIVID INTEREST ALL THE
EVENTS THAT WERE TAKING PLACE IN GERMANY, WHETHER CONNECTED WITH
POLITICAL OR CULTURAL QUESTION. I HAD A FEELING OF PRIDE AND ADMIRATION
WHEN I COMPARED THE RISE OF THE YOUNG GERMAN EMPIRE WITH THE DECLINE OF
THE AUSTRIAN STATE. BUT, ALTHOUGH THE FOREIGN POLICY OF THAT EMPIRE WAS
A SOURCE OF REAL PLEASURE ON THE WHOLE, THE INTERNAL POLITICAL
HAPPENINGS WERE NOT ALWAYS SO SATISFACTORY. I DID NOT APPROVE OF THE
CAMPAIGN WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS BEING CARRIED ON AGAINST WILLIAM II. I
LOOKED UPON HIM NOT ONLY AS THE GERMAN EMPEROR BUT, ABOVE ALL, AS THE
CREATOR OF THE GERMAN NAVY. THE FACT THAT THE EMPEROR WAS PROHIBITED
FROM SPEAKING IN THE REICHSTAG MADE ME VERY ANGRY, BECAUSE THE
PROHIBITION CAME FROM A SIDE WHICH IN MY EYES HAD NO AUTHORITY TO MAKE
IT. FOR AT A SINGLE SITTING THOSE SAME PARLIAMENTARY GANDERS DID MORE
CACKLING TOGETHER THAN THE WHOLE DYNASTY OF EMPERORS, COMPRISING EVEN
THE WEAKEST, HAD DONE IN THE COURSE OF CENTURIES.

IT ANNOYED ME TO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN A NATION WHERE ANY
HALF-WITTED FELLOW COULD CLAIM FOR HIMSELF THE RIGHT TO CRITICIZE AND
MIGHT EVEN BE LET LOOSE ON THE PEOPLE AS A 'LEGISLATOR' IN THE
REICHSTAG, THE BEARER OF THE IMPERIAL CROWN COULD BE THE SUBJECT OF A
'REPRIMAND' ON THE PART OF THE MOST MISERABLE ASSEMBLY OF DRIVELLERS
THAT HAD EVER EXISTED.

I WAS EVEN MORE DISGUSTED AT THE WAY IN WHICH THIS SAME VIENNA PRESS
SALAAMED OBSEQUIOUSLY BEFORE THE MEANEST STEED BELONGING TO THE HABSBURG
ROYAL EQUIPAGE AND WENT OFF INTO WILD ECSTACIES OF DELIGHT IF THE NAG
WAGGED ITS TAIL IN RESPONSE. AND AT THE SAME TIME THESE NEWSPAPERS TOOK
UP AN ATTITUDE OF ANXIETY IN MATTERS THAT CONCERNED THE GERMAN EMPEROR,
TRYING TO CLOAK THEIR ENMITY BY THE SERIOUS AIR THEY GAVE THEMSELVES.
BUT IN MY EYES THAT ENMITY APPEARED TO BE ONLY POORLY CLOAKED. NATURALLY
THEY PROTESTED THAT THEY HAD NO INTENTION OF MIXING IN GERMANY'S
INTERNAL AFFAIRS--GOD FORBID! THEY PRETENDED THAT BY TOUCHING A DELICATE
SPOT IN SUCH A FRIENDLY WAY THEY WERE FULFILLING A DUTY THAT DEVOLVED
UPON THEM BY REASON OF THE MUTUAL ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AND
AT THE SAME TIME DISCHARGING THEIR OBLIGATIONS OF JOURNALISTIC
TRUTHFULNESS. HAVING THUS EXCUSED THEMSELVES ABOUT TENDERLY TOUCHING A
SORE SPOT, THEY BORED WITH THE FINGER RUTHLESSLY INTO THE WOUND.

THAT SORT OF THING MADE MY BLOOD BOIL. AND NOW I BEGAN TO BE MORE AND
MORE ON MY GUARD WHEN READING THE GREAT VIENNA PRESS.

I HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE, HOWEVER, THAT ON SUCH SUBJECTS ONE OF THE
ANTI-SEMITIC PAPERS--THE DEUTSCHE VOLKSBLATT--ACTED MORE DECENTLY.

WHAT GOT STILL MORE ON MY NERVES WAS THE REPUGNANT MANNER IN WHICH THE
BIG NEWSPAPERS CULTIVATED ADMIRATION FOR FRANCE. ONE REALLY HAD TO FEEL
ASHAMED OF BEING A GERMAN WHEN CONFRONTED BY THOSE MELLIFLUOUS HYMNS OF
PRAISE FOR 'THE GREAT CULTURE-NATION'. THIS WRETCHED GALLOMANIA MORE
OFTEN THAN ONCE MADE ME THROW AWAY ONE OF THOSE 'WORLD NEWSPAPERS'. I
NOW OFTEN TURNED TO THE VOLKSBLATT, WHICH WAS MUCH SMALLER IN SIZE BUT
WHICH TREATED SUCH SUBJECTS MORE DECENTLY. I WAS NOT IN ACCORD WITH ITS
SHARP ANTI-SEMITIC TONE; BUT AGAIN AND AGAIN I FOUND THAT ITS ARGUMENTS
GAVE ME GROUNDS FOR SERIOUS THOUGHT.

ANYHOW, IT WAS AS A RESULT OF SUCH READING THAT I CAME TO KNOW THE MAN
AND THE MOVEMENT WHICH THEN DETERMINED THE FATE OF VIENNA. THESE WERE
DR. KARL LUEGER AND THE CHRISTIAN SOCIALIST MOVEMENT. AT THE TIME I CAME
TO VIENNA I FELT OPPOSED TO BOTH. I LOOKED ON THE MAN AND THE MOVEMENT
AS 'REACTIONARY'.

BUT EVEN AN ELEMENTARY SENSE OF JUSTICE ENFORCED ME TO CHANGE MY OPINION
WHEN I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF KNOWING THE MAN AND HIS WORK, AND SLOWLY
THAT OPINION GREW INTO OUTSPOKEN ADMIRATION WHEN I HAD BETTER GROUNDS
FOR FORMING A JUDGMENT. TO-DAY, AS WELL AS THEN, I HOLD DR. KARL LUEGER
AS THE MOST EMINENT TYPE OF GERMAN BURGERMEISTER. HOW MANY PREJUDICES
WERE THROWN OVER THROUGH SUCH A CHANGE IN MY ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE
CHRISTIAN-SOCIALIST MOVEMENT!

MY IDEAS ABOUT ANTI-SEMITISM CHANGED ALSO IN THE COURSE OF TIME, BUT
THAT WAS THE CHANGE WHICH I FOUND MOST DIFFICULT. IT COST ME A GREATER
INTERNAL CONFLICT WITH MYSELF, AND IT WAS ONLY AFTER A STRUGGLE BETWEEN
REASON AND SENTIMENT THAT VICTORY BEGAN TO BE DECIDED IN FAVOUR OF THE
FORMER. TWO YEARS LATER SENTIMENT RALLIED TO THE SIDE OF REASONS AND
BECAME A FAITHFUL GUARDIAN AND COUNSELLOR.

AT THE TIME OF THIS BITTER STRUGGLE, BETWEEN CALM REASON AND THE
SENTIMENTS IN WHICH I HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP, THE LESSONS THAT I LEARNED ON
THE STREETS OF VIENNA RENDERED ME INVALUABLE ASSISTANCE. A TIME CAME
WHEN I NO LONGER PASSED BLINDLY ALONG THE STREET OF THE MIGHTY CITY, AS
I HAD DONE IN THE EARLY DAYS, BUT NOW WITH MY EYES OPEN NOT ONLY TO
STUDY THE BUILDINGS BUT ALSO THE HUMAN BEINGS.

ONCE, WHEN PASSING THROUGH THE INNER CITY, I SUDDENLY ENCOUNTERED A
PHENOMENON IN A LONG CAFTAN AND WEARING BLACK SIDE-LOCKS. MY FIRST
THOUGHT WAS: IS THIS A JEW? THEY CERTAINLY DID NOT HAVE THIS APPEARANCE
IN LINZ. I WATCHED THE MAN STEALTHILY AND CAUTIOUSLY; BUT THE LONGER I
GAZED AT THE STRANGE COUNTENANCE AND EXAMINED IT FEATURE BY FEATURE, THE
MORE THE QUESTION SHAPED ITSELF IN MY BRAIN: IS THIS A GERMAN?

AS WAS ALWAYS MY HABIT WITH SUCH EXPERIENCES, I TURNED TO BOOKS FOR HELP
IN REMOVING MY DOUBTS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I BOUGHT MYSELF
SOME ANTI-SEMITIC PAMPHLETS FOR A FEW PENCE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY ALL
BEGAN WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT IN PRINCIPLE THE READER HAD AT LEAST A
CERTAIN DEGREE OF INFORMATION ON THE JEWISH QUESTION OR WAS EVEN
FAMILIAR WITH IT. MOREOVER, THE TONE OF MOST OF THESE PAMPHLETS WAS SUCH
THAT I BECAME DOUBTFUL AGAIN, BECAUSE THE STATEMENTS MADE WERE PARTLY
SUPERFICIAL AND THE PROOFS EXTRAORDINARILY UNSCIENTIFIC. FOR WEEKS, AND
INDEED FOR MONTHS, I RETURNED TO MY OLD WAY OF THINKING. THE SUBJECT
APPEARED SO ENORMOUS AND THE ACCUSATIONS WERE SO FAR-REACHING THAT I WAS
AFRAID OF DEALING WITH IT UNJUSTLY AND SO I BECAME AGAIN ANXIOUS AND
UNCERTAIN.

NATURALLY I COULD NO LONGER DOUBT THAT HERE THERE WAS NOT A QUESTION OF
GERMANS WHO HAPPENED TO BE OF A DIFFERENT RELIGION BUT RATHER THAT THERE
WAS QUESTION OF AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PEOPLE. FOR AS SOON AS I BEGAN TO
INVESTIGATE THE MATTER AND OBSERVE THE JEWS, THEN VIENNA APPEARED TO ME
IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT. WHEREVER I NOW WENT I SAW JEWS, AND THE MORE I SAW
OF THEM THE MORE STRIKINGLY AND CLEARLY THEY STOOD OUT AS A DIFFERENT
PEOPLE FROM THE OTHER CITIZENS. ESPECIALLY THE INNER CITY AND THE
DISTRICT NORTHWARDS FROM THE DANUBE CANAL SWARMED WITH A PEOPLE WHO,
EVEN IN OUTER APPEARANCE, BORE NO SIMILARITY TO THE GERMANS.

BUT ANY INDECISION WHICH I MAY STILL HAVE FELT ABOUT THAT POINT WAS
FINALLY REMOVED BY THE ACTIVITIES OF A CERTAIN SECTION OF THE JEWS
THEMSELVES. A GREAT MOVEMENT, CALLED ZIONISM, AROSE AMONG THEM. ITS AIM
WAS TO ASSERT THE NATIONAL CHARACTER OF JUDAISM, AND THE MOVEMENT WAS
STRONGLY REPRESENTED IN VIENNA.

TO OUTWARD APPEARANCES IT SEEMED AS IF ONLY ONE GROUP OF JEWS CHAMPIONED
THIS MOVEMENT, WHILE THE GREAT MAJORITY DISAPPROVED OF IT, OR EVEN
REPUDIATED IT. BUT AN INVESTIGATION OF THE SITUATION SHOWED THAT THOSE
OUTWARD APPEARANCES WERE PURPOSELY MISLEADING. THESE OUTWARD APPEARANCES
EMERGED FROM A MIST OF THEORIES WHICH HAD BEEN PRODUCED FOR REASONS OF
EXPEDIENCY, IF NOT FOR PURPOSES OF DOWNRIGHT DECEPTION. FOR THAT PART OF
JEWRY WHICH WAS STYLED LIBERAL DID NOT DISOWN THE ZIONISTS AS IF THEY
WERE NOT MEMBERS OF THEIR RACE BUT RATHER AS BROTHER JEWS WHO PUBLICLY
PROFESSED THEIR FAITH IN AN UNPRACTICAL WAY, SO AS TO CREATE A DANGER
FOR JEWRY ITSELF.

THUS THERE WAS NO REAL RIFT IN THEIR INTERNAL SOLIDARITY.

THIS FICTITIOUS CONFLICT BETWEEN THE ZIONISTS AND THE LIBERAL JEWS SOON
DISGUSTED ME; FOR IT WAS FALSE THROUGH AND THROUGH AND IN DIRECT
CONTRADICTION TO THE MORAL DIGNITY AND IMMACULATE CHARACTER ON WHICH
THAT RACE HAD ALWAYS PRIDED ITSELF.

CLEANLINESS, WHETHER MORAL OR OF ANOTHER KIND, HAD ITS OWN PECULIAR
MEANING FOR THESE PEOPLE. THAT THEY WERE WATER-SHY WAS OBVIOUS ON
LOOKING AT THEM AND, UNFORTUNATELY, VERY OFTEN ALSO WHEN NOT LOOKING AT
THEM AT ALL. THE ODOUR OF THOSE PEOPLE IN CAFTANS OFTEN USED TO MAKE ME
FEEL ILL. BEYOND THAT THERE WERE THE UNKEMPT CLOTHES AND THE IGNOBLE
EXTERIOR.

ALL THESE DETAILS WERE CERTAINLY NOT ATTRACTIVE; BUT THE REVOLTING
FEATURE WAS THAT BENEATH THEIR UNCLEAN EXTERIOR ONE SUDDENLY PERCEIVED
THE MORAL MILDEW OF THE CHOSEN RACE.

WHAT SOON GAVE ME CAUSE FOR VERY SERIOUS CONSIDERATION WERE THE
ACTIVITIES OF THE JEWS IN CERTAIN BRANCHES OF LIFE, INTO THE MYSTERY OF
WHICH I PENETRATED LITTLE BY LITTLE. WAS THERE ANY SHADY UNDERTAKING,
ANY FORM OF FOULNESS, ESPECIALLY IN CULTURAL LIFE, IN WHICH AT LEAST ONE
JEW DID NOT PARTICIPATE? ON PUTTING THE PROBING KNIFE CAREFULLY TO THAT
KIND OF ABSCESS ONE IMMEDIATELY DISCOVERED, LIKE A MAGGOT IN A
PUTRESCENT BODY, A LITTLE JEW WHO WAS OFTEN BLINDED BY THE SUDDEN LIGHT.

IN MY EYES THE CHARGE AGAINST JUDAISM BECAME A GRAVE ONE THE MOMENT I
DISCOVERED THE JEWISH ACTIVITIES IN THE PRESS, IN ART, IN LITERATURE AND
THE THEATRE. ALL UNCTUOUS PROTESTS WERE NOW MORE OR LESS FUTILE. ONE
NEEDED ONLY TO LOOK AT THE POSTERS ANNOUNCING THE HIDEOUS PRODUCTIONS OF
THE CINEMA AND THEATRE, AND STUDY THE NAMES OF THE AUTHORS WHO WERE
HIGHLY LAUDED THERE IN ORDER TO BECOME PERMANENTLY ADAMANT ON JEWISH
QUESTIONS. HERE WAS A PESTILENCE, A MORAL PESTILENCE, WITH WHICH THE
PUBLIC WAS BEING INFECTED. IT WAS WORSE THAN THE BLACK PLAGUE OF LONG
AGO. AND IN WHAT MIGHTY DOSES THIS POISON WAS MANUFACTURED AND
DISTRIBUTED. NATURALLY, THE LOWER THE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL LEVEL OF
SUCH AN AUTHOR OF ARTISTIC PRODUCTS THE MORE INEXHAUSTIBLE HIS
FECUNDITY. SOMETIMES IT WENT SO FAR THAT ONE OF THESE FELLOWS, ACTING
LIKE A SEWAGE PUMP, WOULD SHOOT HIS FILTH DIRECTLY IN THE FACE OF OTHER
MEMBERS OF THE HUMAN RACE. IN THIS CONNECTION WE MUST REMEMBER THERE IS
NO LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF SUCH PEOPLE. ONE OUGHT TO REALIZE THAT FOR
ONE, GOETHE, NATURE MAY BRING INTO EXISTENCE TEN THOUSAND SUCH
DESPOILERS WHO ACT AS THE WORST KIND OF GERM-CARRIERS IN POISONING HUMAN
SOULS. IT WAS A TERRIBLE THOUGHT, AND YET IT COULD NOT BE AVOIDED, THAT
THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE JEWS SEEMED SPECIALLY DESTINED BY NATURE TO
PLAY THIS SHAMEFUL PART.

AND IS IT FOR THIS REASON THAT THEY CAN BE CALLED THE CHOSEN PEOPLE?

I BEGAN THEN TO INVESTIGATE CAREFULLY THE NAMES OF ALL THE FABRICATORS
OF THESE UNCLEAN PRODUCTS IN PUBLIC CULTURAL LIFE. THE RESULT OF THAT
INQUIRY WAS STILL MORE DISFAVOURABLE TO THE ATTITUDE WHICH I HAD
HITHERTO HELD IN REGARD TO THE JEWS. THOUGH MY FEELINGS MIGHT REBEL A
THOUSAND TIME, REASON NOW HAD TO DRAW ITS OWN CONCLUSIONS.

THE FACT THAT NINE-TENTHS OF ALL THE SMUTTY LITERATURE, ARTISTIC TRIPE
AND THEATRICAL BANALITIES, HAD TO BE CHARGED TO THE ACCOUNT OF PEOPLE
WHO FORMED SCARCELY ONE PER CENT. OF THE NATION--THAT FACT COULD NOT BE
GAINSAID. IT WAS THERE, AND HAD TO BE ADMITTED. THEN I BEGAN TO EXAMINE
MY FAVOURITE 'WORLD PRESS', WITH THAT FACT BEFORE MY MIND.

THE DEEPER MY SOUNDINGS WENT THE LESSER GREW MY RESPECT FOR THAT PRESS
WHICH I FORMERLY ADMIRED. ITS STYLE BECAME STILL MORE REPELLENT AND I
WAS FORCED TO REJECT ITS IDEAS AS ENTIRELY SHALLOW AND SUPERFICIAL. TO
CLAIM THAT IN THE PRESENTATION OF FACTS AND VIEWS ITS ATTITUDE WAS
IMPARTIAL SEEMED TO ME TO CONTAIN MORE FALSEHOOD THAN TRUTH. THE WRITERS
WERE--JEWS.

THOUSANDS OF DETAILS THAT I HAD SCARCELY NOTICED BEFORE SEEMED TO ME NOW
TO DESERVE ATTENTION. I BEGAN TO GRASP AND UNDERSTAND THINGS WHICH I HAD
FORMERLY LOOKED AT IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT.

I SAW THE LIBERAL POLICY OF THAT PRESS IN ANOTHER LIGHT. ITS DIGNIFIED
TONE IN REPLYING TO THE ATTACKS OF ITS ADVERSARIES AND ITS DEAD SILENCE
IN OTHER CASES NOW BECAME CLEAR TO ME AS PART OF A CUNNING AND
DESPICABLE WAY OF DECEIVING THE READERS. ITS BRILLIANT THEATRICAL
CRITICISMS ALWAYS PRAISED THE JEWISH AUTHORS AND ITS ADVERSE, CRITICISM
WAS RESERVED EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE GERMANS.

THE LIGHT PIN-PRICKS AGAINST WILLIAM II SHOWED THE PERSISTENCY OF ITS
POLICY, JUST AS DID ITS SYSTEMATIC COMMENDATION OF FRENCH CULTURE AND
CIVILIZATION. THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE FEUILLETONS WAS TRIVIAL AND
OFTEN PORNOGRAPHIC. THE LANGUAGE OF THIS PRESS AS A WHOLE HAD THE ACCENT
OF A FOREIGN PEOPLE. THE GENERAL TONE WAS OPENLY DEROGATORY TO THE
GERMANS AND THIS MUST HAVE BEEN DEFINITELY INTENTIONAL.

WHAT WERE THE INTERESTS THAT URGED THE VIENNA PRESS TO ADOPT SUCH A
POLICY? OR DID THEY DO SO MERELY BY CHANCE? IN ATTEMPTING TO FIND AN
ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS I GRADUALLY BECAME MORE AND MORE DUBIOUS.

THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED WHICH HELPED ME TO COME TO AN EARLY DECISION. I
BEGAN TO SEE THROUGH THE MEANING OF A WHOLE SERIES OF EVENTS THAT WERE
TAKING PLACE IN OTHER BRANCHES OF VIENNESE LIFE. ALL THESE WERE INSPIRED
BY A GENERAL CONCEPT OF MANNERS AND MORALS WHICH WAS OPENLY PUT INTO
PRACTICE BY A LARGE SECTION OF THE JEWS AND COULD BE ESTABLISHED AS
ATTRIBUTABLE TO THEM. HERE, AGAIN, THE LIFE WHICH I OBSERVED ON THE
STREETS TAUGHT ME WHAT EVIL REALLY IS.

THE PART WHICH THE JEWS PLAYED IN THE SOCIAL PHENOMENON OF PROSTITUTION,
AND MORE ESPECIALLY IN THE WHITE SLAVE TRAFFIC, COULD BE STUDIED HERE
BETTER THAN IN ANY OTHER WEST-EUROPEAN CITY, WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION
OF CERTAIN PORTS IN SOUTHERN FRANCE. WALKING BY NIGHT ALONG THE STREETS
OF THE LEOPOLDSTADT, ALMOST AT EVERY TURN WHETHER ONE WISHED IT OR NOT,
ONE WITNESSED CERTAIN HAPPENINGS OF WHOSE EXISTENCE THE GERMANS KNEW
NOTHING UNTIL THE WAR MADE IT POSSIBLE AND INDEED INEVITABLE FOR THE
SOLDIERS TO SEE SUCH THINGS ON THE EASTERN FRONT.

A COLD SHIVER RAN DOWN MY SPINE WHEN I FIRST ASCERTAINED THAT IT WAS THE
SAME KIND OF COLD-BLOODED, THICK-SKINNED AND SHAMELESS JEW WHO SHOWED
HIS CONSUMMATE SKILL IN CONDUCTING THAT REVOLTING EXPLOITATION OF THE
DREGS OF THE BIG CITY. THEN I BECAME FIRED WITH WRATH.

I HAD NOW NO MORE HESITATION ABOUT BRINGING THE JEWISH PROBLEM TO LIGHT
IN ALL ITS DETAILS. NO. HENCEFORTH I WAS DETERMINED TO DO SO. BUT AS I
LEARNED TO TRACK DOWN THE JEW IN ALL THE DIFFERENT SPHERES OF CULTURAL
AND ARTISTIC LIFE, AND IN THE VARIOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF THIS LIFE
EVERYWHERE, I SUDDENLY CAME UPON HIM IN A POSITION WHERE I HAD LEAST
EXPECTED TO FIND HIM. I NOW REALIZED THAT THE JEWS WERE THE LEADERS OF
SOCIAL DEMOCRACY. IN FACE OF THAT REVELATION THE SCALES FELL FROM MY
EYES. MY LONG INNER STRUGGLE WAS AT AN END.

IN MY RELATIONS WITH MY FELLOW WORKMEN I WAS OFTEN ASTONISHED TO FIND
HOW EASILY AND OFTEN THEY CHANGED THEIR OPINIONS ON THE SAME QUESTIONS,
SOMETIMES WITHIN A FEW DAYS AND SOMETIMES EVEN WITHIN THE COURSE OF A
FEW HOURS. I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW MEN WHO ALWAYS HAD
REASONABLE IDEAS WHEN THEY SPOKE AS INDIVIDUALS WITH ONE ANOTHER
SUDDENLY LOST THIS REASONABLENESS THE MOMENT THEY ACTED IN THE MASS.
THAT PHENOMENON OFTEN TEMPTED ONE ALMOST TO DESPAIR. I USED TO DISPUTE
WITH THEM FOR HOURS AND WHEN I SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING THEM TO WHAT I
CONSIDERED A REASONABLE WAY OF THINKING I REJOICED AT MY SUCCESS. BUT
NEXT DAY I WOULD FIND THAT IT HAD BEEN ALL IN VAIN. IT WAS SADDENING TO
THINK I HAD TO BEGIN IT ALL OVER AGAIN. LIKE A PENDULUM IN ITS ETERNAL
SWAY, THEY WOULD FALL BACK INTO THEIR ABSURD OPINIONS.

I WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR POSITION FULLY. THEY WERE DISSATISFIED
WITH THEIR LOT AND CURSED THE FATE WHICH HAD HIT THEM SO HARD. THEY
HATED THEIR EMPLOYERS, WHOM THEY LOOKED UPON AS THE HEARTLESS
ADMINISTRATORS OF THEIR CRUEL DESTINY. OFTEN THEY USED ABUSIVE LANGUAGE
AGAINST THE PUBLIC OFFICIALS, WHOM THEY ACCUSED OF HAVING NO SYMPATHY
WITH THE SITUATION OF THE WORKING PEOPLE. THEY MADE PUBLIC PROTESTS
AGAINST THE COST OF LIVING AND PARADED THROUGH THE STREETS IN DEFENCE OF
THEIR CLAIMS. AT LEAST ALL THIS COULD BE EXPLAINED ON REASONABLE
GROUNDS. BUT WHAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND WAS THE BOUNDLESS HATRED
THEY EXPRESSED AGAINST THEIR OWN FELLOW CITIZENS, HOW THEY DISPARAGED
THEIR OWN NATION, MOCKED AT ITS GREATNESS, REVILED ITS HISTORY AND
DRAGGED THE NAMES OF ITS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS MEN IN THE GUTTER.

THIS HOSTILITY TOWARDS THEIR OWN KITH AND KIN, THEIR OWN NATIVE LAND AND
HOME WAS AS IRRATIONAL AS IT WAS INCOMPREHENSIBLE. IT WAS AGAINST
NATURE.

ONE COULD CURE THAT MALADY TEMPORARILY, BUT ONLY FOR SOME DAYS OR AT
LEAST SOME WEEKS. BUT ON MEETING THOSE WHOM ONE BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN
CONVERTED ONE FOUND THAT THEY HAD BECOME AS THEY WERE BEFORE. THAT
MALADY AGAINST NATURE HELD THEM ONCE AGAIN IN ITS CLUTCHES.

I GRADUALLY DISCOVERED THAT THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PRESS WAS
PREDOMINANTLY CONTROLLED BY JEWS. BUT I DID NOT ATTACH SPECIAL
IMPORTANCE TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, FOR THE SAME STATE OF AFFAIRS EXISTED
ALSO IN OTHER NEWSPAPERS. BUT THERE WAS ONE STRIKING FACT IN THIS
CONNECTION. IT WAS THAT THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE NEWSPAPER WITH WHICH JEWS
WERE CONNECTED THAT COULD BE SPOKEN OF AS NATIONAL, IN THE MEANING THAT
MY EDUCATION AND CONVICTIONS ATTACHED TO THAT WORD.

MAKING AN EFFORT TO OVERCOME MY NATURAL RELUCTANCE, I TRIED TO READ
ARTICLES OF THIS NATURE PUBLISHED IN THE MARXIST PRESS; BUT IN DOING SO
MY AVERSION INCREASED ALL THE MORE. AND THEN I SET ABOUT LEARNING
SOMETHING OF THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE AND PUBLISHED THIS MISCHIEVOUS STUFF.
FROM THE PUBLISHER DOWNWARDS, ALL OF THEM WERE JEWS. I RECALLED TO MIND
THE NAMES OF THE PUBLIC LEADERS OF MARXISM, AND THEN I REALIZED THAT
MOST OF THEM BELONGED TO THE CHOSEN RACE--THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC
REPRESENTATIVES IN THE IMPERIAL CABINET AS WELL AS THE SECRETARIES OF
THE TRADES UNIONS AND THE STREET AGITATORS. EVERYWHERE THE SAME SINISTER
PICTURE PRESENTED ITSELF. I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE ROW OF
NAMES--AUSTERLITZ, DAVID, ADLER, ELLENBOGEN, AND OTHERS. ONE FACT BECAME
QUITE EVIDENT TO ME. IT WAS THAT THIS ALIEN RACE HELD IN ITS HANDS THE
LEADERSHIP OF THAT SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY WITH WHOSE MINOR
REPRESENTATIVES I HAD BEEN DISPUTING FOR MONTHS PAST. I WAS HAPPY AT
LAST TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT THE JEW IS NOT A GERMAN.

THUS I FINALLY DISCOVERED WHO WERE THE EVIL SPIRITS LEADING OUR PEOPLE
ASTRAY. THE SOJOURN IN VIENNA FOR ONE YEAR HAD PROVED LONG ENOUGH TO
CONVINCE ME THAT NO WORKER IS SO ROOTED IN HIS PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS THAT
HE WILL NOT SURRENDER THEM IN FACE OF BETTER AND CLEARER ARGUMENTS AND
EXPLANATIONS. GRADUALLY I BECAME AN EXPERT IN THE DOCTRINE OF THE
MARXISTS AND USED THIS KNOWLEDGE AS AN INSTRUMENT TO DRIVE HOME MY OWN
FIRM CONVICTIONS. I WAS SUCCESSFUL IN NEARLY EVERY CASE. THE GREAT
MASSES CAN BE RESCUED, BUT A LOT OF TIME AND A LARGE SHARE OF HUMAN
PATIENCE MUST BE DEVOTED TO SUCH WORK.

BUT A JEW CAN NEVER BE RESCUED FROM HIS FIXED NOTIONS.

IT WAS THEN SIMPLE ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT TO SHOW THEM THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR
TEACHING. WITHIN MY SMALL CIRCLE I TALKED TO THEM UNTIL MY THROAT ACHED
AND MY VOICE GREW HOARSE. I BELIEVED THAT I COULD FINALLY CONVINCE THEM
OF THE DANGER INHERENT IN THE MARXIST FOLLIES. BUT I ONLY ACHIEVED THE
CONTRARY RESULT. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IMMEDIATELY THE DISASTROUS EFFECTS
OF THE MARXIST THEORY AND ITS APPLICATION IN PRACTICE BECAME EVIDENT,
THE STRONGER BECAME THEIR OBSTINACY.

THE MORE I DEBATED WITH THEM THE MORE FAMILIAR I BECAME WITH THEIR
ARGUMENTATIVE TACTICS. AT THE OUTSET THEY COUNTED UPON THE STUPIDITY OF
THEIR OPPONENTS, BUT WHEN THEY GOT SO ENTANGLED THAT THEY COULD NOT FIND
A WAY OUT THEY PLAYED THE TRICK OF ACTING AS INNOCENT SIMPLETONS. SHOULD
THEY FAIL, IN SPITE OF THEIR TRICKS OF LOGIC, THEY ACTED AS IF THEY
COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE COUNTER ARGUMENTS AND BOLTED AWAY TO ANOTHER
FIELD OF DISCUSSION. THEY WOULD LAY DOWN TRUISMS AND PLATITUDES; AND, IF
YOU ACCEPTED THESE, THEN THEY WERE APPLIED TO OTHER PROBLEMS AND MATTERS
OF AN ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT NATURE FROM THE ORIGINAL THEME. IF YOU FACED
THEM WITH THIS POINT THEY WOULD ESCAPE AGAIN, AND YOU COULD NOT BRING
THEM TO MAKE ANY PRECISE STATEMENT. WHENEVER ONE TRIED TO GET A FIRM
GRIP ON ANY OF THESE APOSTLES ONE'S HAND GRASPED ONLY JELLY AND SLIME
WHICH SLIPPED THROUGH THE FINGERS AND COMBINED AGAIN INTO A SOLID MASS A
MOMENT AFTERWARDS. IF YOUR ADVERSARY FELT FORCED TO GIVE IN TO YOUR
ARGUMENT, ON ACCOUNT OF THE OBSERVERS PRESENT, AND IF YOU THEN THOUGHT
THAT AT LAST YOU HAD GAINED GROUND, A SURPRISE WAS IN STORE FOR YOU ON
THE FOLLOWING DAY. THE JEW WOULD BE UTTERLY OBLIVIOUS TO WHAT HAD
HAPPENED THE DAY BEFORE, AND HE WOULD START ONCE AGAIN BY REPEATING HIS
FORMER ABSURDITIES, AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. SHOULD YOU BECOME
INDIGNANT AND REMIND HIM OF YESTERDAY'S DEFEAT, HE PRETENDED
ASTONISHMENT AND COULD NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING, EXCEPT THAT ON THE
PREVIOUS DAY HE HAD PROVED THAT HIS STATEMENTS WERE CORRECT. SOMETIMES I
WAS DUMBFOUNDED. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT AMAZED ME THE MORE--THE ABUNDANCE OF
THEIR VERBIAGE OR THE ARTFUL WAY IN WHICH THEY DRESSED UP THEIR
FALSEHOODS. I GRADUALLY CAME TO HATE THEM.

YET ALL THIS HAD ITS GOOD SIDE; BECAUSE THE MORE I CAME TO KNOW THE
INDIVIDUAL LEADERS, OR AT LEAST THE PROPAGANDISTS, OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY,
MY LOVE FOR MY OWN PEOPLE INCREASED CORRESPONDINGLY. CONSIDERING THE
SATANIC SKILL WHICH THESE EVIL COUNSELLORS DISPLAYED, HOW COULD THEIR
UNFORTUNATE VICTIMS BE BLAMED? INDEED, I FOUND IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT
MYSELF TO BE A MATCH FOR THE DIALECTICAL PERFIDY OF THAT RACE. HOW
FUTILE IT WAS TO TRY TO WIN OVER SUCH PEOPLE WITH ARGUMENT, SEEING THAT
THEIR VERY MOUTHS DISTORTED THE TRUTH, DISOWNING THE VERY WORDS THEY HAD
JUST USED AND ADOPTING THEM AGAIN A FEW MOMENTS AFTERWARDS TO SERVE
THEIR OWN ENDS IN THE ARGUMENT! NO. THE MORE I CAME TO KNOW THE JEW, THE
EASIER IT WAS TO EXCUSE THE WORKERS.

IN MY OPINION THE MOST CULPABLE WERE NOT TO BE FOUND AMONG THE WORKERS
BUT RATHER AMONG THOSE WHO DID NOT THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO TAKE THE
TROUBLE TO SYMPATHIZE WITH THEIR OWN KINSFOLK AND GIVE TO THE
HARD-WORKING SON OF THE NATIONAL FAMILY WHAT WAS HIS BY THE IRON LOGIC
OF JUSTICE, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PLACING HIS SEDUCER AND CORRUPTER
AGAINST THE WALL.

URGED BY MY OWN DAILY EXPERIENCES, I NOW BEGAN TO INVESTIGATE MORE
THOROUGHLY THE SOURCES OF THE MARXIST TEACHING ITSELF. ITS EFFECTS WERE
WELL KNOWN TO ME IN DETAIL. AS A RESULT OF CAREFUL OBSERVATION, ITS
DAILY PROGRESS HAD BECOME OBVIOUS TO ME. AND ONE NEEDED ONLY A LITTLE
IMAGINATION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FORECAST THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH MUST
RESULT FROM IT. THE ONLY QUESTION NOW WAS: DID THE FOUNDERS FORESEE THE
EFFECTS OF THEIR WORK IN THE FORM WHICH THOSE EFFECTS HAVE SHOWN
THEMSELVES TO-DAY, OR WERE THE FOUNDERS THEMSELVES THE VICTIMS OF AN
ERROR? TO MY MIND BOTH ALTERNATIVES WERE POSSIBLE.

IF THE SECOND QUESTION MUST BE ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THEN IT WAS
THE DUTY OF EVERY THINKING PERSON TO OPPOSE THIS SINISTER MOVEMENT WITH
A VIEW TO PREVENTING IT FROM PRODUCING ITS WORST RESULTS. BUT IF THE
FIRST QUESTION MUST BE ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THEN IT MUST BE
ADMITTED THAT THE ORIGINAL AUTHORS OF THIS EVIL WHICH HAS INFECTED THE
NATIONS WERE DEVILS INCARNATE. FOR ONLY IN THE BRAIN OF A MONSTER, AND
NOT THAT OF A MAN, COULD THE PLAN OF THIS ORGANIZATION TAKE SHAPE WHOSE
WORKINGS MUST FINALLY BRING ABOUT THE COLLAPSE OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION AND
TURN THIS WORLD INTO A DESERT WASTE.

SUCH BEING THE CASE THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE LEFT WAS TO FIGHT, AND IN THAT
FIGHT TO EMPLOY ALL THE WEAPONS WHICH THE HUMAN SPIRIT AND INTELLECT AND
WILL COULD FURNISH LEAVING IT TO FATE TO DECIDE IN WHOSE FAVOUR THE
BALANCE SHOULD FALL.

AND SO I BEGAN TO GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE AUTHORS OF THIS TEACHING,
WITH A VIEW TO STUDYING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE MOVEMENT. THE FACT THAT I
ATTAINED MY OBJECT SOONER THAN I COULD HAVE ANTICIPATED WAS DUE TO THE
DEEPER INSIGHT INTO THE JEWISH QUESTION WHICH I THEN GAINED, MY
KNOWLEDGE OF THIS QUESTION BEING HITHERTO RATHER SUPERFICIAL. THIS NEWLY
ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE ALONE ENABLED ME TO MAKE A PRACTICAL COMPARISON
BETWEEN THE REAL CONTENT AND THE THEORETICAL PRETENTIOUSNESS OF THE
TEACHING LAID DOWN BY THE APOSTOLIC FOUNDERS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY;
BECAUSE I NOW UNDERSTOOD THE LANGUAGE OF THE JEW. I REALIZED THAT THE
JEW USES LANGUAGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISSIMULATING HIS THOUGHT OR AT
LEAST VEILING IT, SO THAT HIS REAL AIM CANNOT BE DISCOVERED BY WHAT HE
SAYS BUT RATHER BY READING BETWEEN THE LINES. THIS KNOWLEDGE WAS THE
OCCASION OF THE GREATEST INNER REVOLUTION THAT I HAD YET EXPERIENCED.
FROM BEING A SOFT-HEARTED COSMOPOLITAN I BECAME AN OUT-AND-OUT
ANTI-SEMITE.

ONLY ON ONE FURTHER OCCASION, AND THAT FOR THE LAST TIME, DID I GIVE WAY
TO OPPRESSING THOUGHTS WHICH CAUSED ME SOME MOMENTS OF PROFOUND ANXIETY.

AS I CRITICALLY REVIEWED THE ACTIVITIES OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE THROUGHOUT
LONG PERIODS OF HISTORY I BECAME ANXIOUS AND ASKED MYSELF WHETHER FOR
SOME INSCRUTABLE REASONS BEYOND THE COMPREHENSION OF POOR MORTALS SUCH
AS OURSELVES, DESTINY MAY NOT HAVE IRREVOCABLY DECREED THAT THE FINAL
VICTORY MUST GO TO THIS SMALL NATION? MAY IT NOT BE THAT THIS PEOPLE
WHICH HAS LIVED ONLY FOR THE EARTH HAS BEEN PROMISED THE EARTH AS A
RECOMPENSE? IS OUR RIGHT TO STRUGGLE FOR OUR OWN SELF-PRESERVATION BASED
ON REALITY, OR IS IT A MERELY SUBJECTIVE THING? FATE ANSWERED THE
QUESTION FOR ME INASMUCH AS IT LED ME TO MAKE A DETACHED AND EXHAUSTIVE
INQUIRY INTO THE MARXIST TEACHING AND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE JEWISH
PEOPLE IN CONNECTION WITH IT.

THE JEWISH DOCTRINE OF MARXISM REPUDIATES THE ARISTOCRATIC PRINCIPLE OF
NATURE AND SUBSTITUTES FOR IT THE ETERNAL PRIVILEGE OF FORCE AND ENERGY,
NUMERICAL MASS AND ITS DEAD WEIGHT. THUS IT DENIES THE INDIVIDUAL WORTH
OF THE HUMAN PERSONALITY, IMPUGNS THE TEACHING THAT NATIONHOOD AND RACE
HAVE A PRIMARY SIGNIFICANCE, AND BY DOING THIS IT TAKES AWAY THE VERY
FOUNDATIONS OF HUMAN EXISTENCE AND HUMAN CIVILIZATION. IF THE MARXIST
TEACHING WERE TO BE ACCEPTED AS THE FOUNDATION OF THE LIFE OF THE
UNIVERSE, IT WOULD LEAD TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ALL ORDER THAT IS
CONCEIVABLE TO THE HUMAN MIND. AND THUS THE ADOPTION OF SUCH A LAW WOULD
PROVOKE CHAOS IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE GREATEST ORGANISM THAT WE KNOW,
WITH THE RESULT THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THIS EARTHLY PLANET WOULD
FINALLY DISAPPEAR.

SHOULD THE JEW, WITH THE AID OF HIS MARXIST CREED, TRIUMPH OVER THE
PEOPLE OF THIS WORLD, HIS CROWN WILL BE THE FUNERAL WREATH OF MANKIND,
AND THIS PLANET WILL ONCE AGAIN FOLLOW ITS ORBIT THROUGH ETHER, WITHOUT
ANY HUMAN LIFE ON ITS SURFACE, AS IT DID MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO.

AND SO I BELIEVE TO-DAY THAT MY CONDUCT IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WILL
OF THE ALMIGHTY CREATOR. IN STANDING GUARD AGAINST THE JEW I AM
DEFENDING THE HANDIWORK OF THE LORD.




CHAPTER III



POLITICAL REFLECTIONS ARISING OUT OF MY SOJOURN IN VIENNA


GENERALLY SPEAKING A MAN SHOULD NOT PUBLICLY TAKE PART IN POLITICS
BEFORE HE HAS REACHED THE AGE OF THIRTY, THOUGH, OF COURSE, EXCEPTIONS
MUST BE MADE IN THE CASE OF THOSE WHO ARE NATURALLY GIFTED WITH
EXTRAORDINARY POLITICAL ABILITIES. THAT AT LEAST IS MY OPINION TO-DAY.
AND THE REASON FOR IT IS THAT UNTIL HE REACHES HIS THIRTIETH YEAR OR
THEREABOUTS A MAN'S MENTAL DEVELOPMENT WILL MOSTLY CONSIST IN ACQUIRING
AND SIFTING SUCH KNOWLEDGE AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE GROUNDWORK OF A
GENERAL PLATFORM FROM WHICH HE CAN EXAMINE THE DIFFERENT POLITICAL
PROBLEMS THAT ARISE FROM DAY TO DAY AND BE ABLE TO ADOPT A DEFINITE
ATTITUDE TOWARDS EACH. A MAN MUST FIRST ACQUIRE A FUND OF GENERAL IDEAS
AND FIT THEM TOGETHER SO AS TO FORM AN ORGANIC STRUCTURE OF PERSONAL
THOUGHT OR OUTLOOK ON LIFE--A WELTANSCHAUUNG. THEN HE WILL HAVE THAT
MENTAL EQUIPMENT WITHOUT WHICH HE CANNOT FORM HIS OWN JUDGMENTS ON
PARTICULAR QUESTIONS OF THE DAY, AND HE WILL HAVE ACQUIRED THOSE
QUALITIES THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR CONSISTENCY AND STEADFASTNESS IN THE
FORMATION OF POLITICAL OPINIONS. SUCH A MAN IS NOW QUALIFIED, AT LEAST
SUBJECTIVELY, TO TAKE HIS PART IN THE POLITICAL CONDUCT OF PUBLIC
AFFAIRS.

IF THESE PRE-REQUISITE CONDITIONS ARE NOT FULFILLED, AND IF A MAN SHOULD
ENTER POLITICAL LIFE WITHOUT THIS EQUIPMENT, HE WILL RUN A TWOFOLD RISK.
IN THE FIRST PLACE, HE MAY FIND DURING THE COURSE OF EVENTS THAT THE
STAND WHICH HE ORIGINALLY TOOK IN REGARD TO SOME ESSENTIAL QUESTION WAS
WRONG. HE WILL NOW HAVE TO ABANDON HIS FORMER POSITION OR ELSE STICK TO
IT AGAINST HIS BETTER KNOWLEDGE AND RIPER WISDOM AND AFTER HIS REASON
AND CONVICTIONS HAVE ALREADY PROVED IT UNTENABLE. IF HE ADOPT THE FORMER
LINE OF ACTION HE WILL FIND HIMSELF IN A DIFFICULT PERSONAL SITUATION;
BECAUSE IN GIVING UP A POSITION HITHERTO MAINTAINED HE WILL APPEAR
INCONSISTENT AND WILL HAVE NO RIGHT TO EXPECT HIS FOLLOWERS TO REMAIN AS
LOYAL TO HIS LEADERSHIP AS THEY WERE BEFORE. AND, AS REGARDS THE
FOLLOWERS THEMSELVES, THEY MAY EASILY LOOK UPON THEIR LEADER'S CHANGE OF
POLICY AS SHOWING A LACK OF JUDGMENT INHERENT IN HIS CHARACTER.
MOREOVER, THE CHANGE MUST CAUSE IN THEM A CERTAIN FEELING OF
DISCOMFITURE VIS-Ã€-VIS THOSE WHOM THE LEADER FORMERLY OPPOSED.

IF HE ADOPTS THE SECOND ALTERNATIVE--WHICH SO VERY FREQUENTLY HAPPENS
TO-DAY--THEN PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS OF THE LEADER HAVE NO LONGER HIS
PERSONAL PERSUASION TO SUPPORT THEM. AND THE MORE THAT IS THE CASE THE
DEFENCE OF HIS CAUSE WILL BE ALL THE MORE HOLLOW AND SUPERFICIAL. HE NOW
DESCENDS TO THE ADOPTION OF VULGAR MEANS IN HIS DEFENCE. WHILE HE
HIMSELF NO LONGER DREAMS SERIOUSLY OF STANDING BY HIS POLITICAL
PROTESTATIONS TO THE LAST--FOR NO MAN WILL DIE IN DEFENCE OF SOMETHING
IN WHICH HE DOES NOT BELIEVE--HE MAKES INCREASING DEMANDS ON HIS
FOLLOWERS. INDEED, THE GREATER BE THE MEASURE OF HIS OWN INSINCERITY,
THE MORE UNFORTUNATE AND INCONSIDERATE BECOME HIS CLAIMS ON HIS PARTY
ADHERENTS. FINALLY, HE THROWS ASIDE THE LAST VESTIGES OF TRUE LEADERSHIP
AND BEGINS TO PLAY POLITICS. THIS MEANS THAT HE BECOMES ONE OF THOSE
WHOSE ONLY CONSISTENCY IS THEIR INCONSISTENCY, ASSOCIATED WITH
OVERBEARING INSOLENCE AND OFTENTIMES AN ARTFUL MENDACITY DEVELOPED TO A
SHAMELESSLY HIGH DEGREE.

SHOULD SUCH A PERSON, TO THE MISFORTUNE OF ALL DECENT PEOPLE, SUCCEED IN
BECOMING A PARLIAMENTARY DEPUTY IT WILL BE CLEAR FROM THE OUTSET THAT
FOR HIM THE ESSENCE OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY CONSISTS IN A HEROIC STRUGGLE
TO KEEP PERMANENT HOLD ON THIS MILK-BOTTLE AS A SOURCE OF LIVELIHOOD FOR
HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY. THE MORE HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN ARE DEPENDENT ON
HIM, THE MORE STUBBORNLY WILL HE FIGHT TO MAINTAIN FOR HIMSELF THE
REPRESENTATION OF HIS PARLIAMENTARY CONSTITUENCY. FOR THAT REASON ANY
OTHER PERSON WHO GIVES EVIDENCE OF POLITICAL CAPACITY IS HIS PERSONAL
ENEMY. IN EVERY NEW MOVEMENT HE WILL APPREHEND THE POSSIBLE BEGINNING OF
HIS OWN DOWNFALL. AND EVERYONE WHO IS A BETTER MAN THAN HIMSELF WILL
APPEAR TO HIM IN THE LIGHT OF A MENACE.

I SHALL SUBSEQUENTLY DEAL MORE FULLY WITH THE PROBLEM TO WHICH THIS KIND
OF PARLIAMENTARY VERMIN GIVE RISE.

WHEN A MAN HAS REACHED HIS THIRTIETH YEAR HE HAS STILL A GREAT DEAL TO
LEARN. THAT IS OBVIOUS. BUT HENCEFORWARD WHAT HE LEARNS WILL PRINCIPALLY
BE AN AMPLIFICATION OF HIS BASIC IDEAS; IT WILL BE FITTED IN WITH THEM
ORGANICALLY SO AS TO FILL UP THE FRAMEWORK OF THE FUNDAMENTAL
WELTANSCHAUUNG WHICH HE ALREADY POSSESSES. WHAT HE LEARNS ANEW WILL NOT
IMPLY THE ABANDONMENT OF PRINCIPLES ALREADY HELD, BUT RATHER A DEEPER
KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE PRINCIPLES. AND THUS HIS COLLEAGUES WILL NEVER HAVE
THE DISCOMFORTING FEELING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN HITHERTO FALSELY LED BY
HIM. ON THE CONTRARY, THEIR CONFIDENCE IS INCREASED WHEN THEY PERCEIVE
THAT THEIR LEADER'S QUALITIES ARE STEADILY DEVELOPING ALONG THE LINES OF
AN ORGANIC GROWTH WHICH RESULTS FROM THE CONSTANT ASSIMILATION OF NEW
IDEAS; SO THAT THE FOLLOWERS LOOK UPON THIS PROCESS AS SIGNIFYING AN
ENRICHMENT OF THE DOCTRINES IN WHICH THEY THEMSELVES BELIEVE, IN THEIR
EYES EVERY SUCH DEVELOPMENT IS A NEW WITNESS TO THE CORRECTNESS OF THAT
WHOLE BODY OF OPINION WHICH HAS HITHERTO BEEN HELD.

A LEADER WHO HAS TO ABANDON THE PLATFORM FOUNDED ON HIS GENERAL
PRINCIPLES, BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZES THE FOUNDATION AS FALSE, CAN ACT WITH
HONOUR ONLY WHEN HE DECLARES HIS READINESS TO ACCEPT THE FINAL
CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ERRONEOUS VIEWS. IN SUCH A CASE HE OUGHT TO REFRAIN
FROM TAKING PUBLIC PART IN ANY FURTHER POLITICAL ACTIVITY. HAVING ONCE
GONE ASTRAY ON ESSENTIAL THINGS HE MAY POSSIBLY GO ASTRAY A SECOND TIME.
BUT, ANYHOW, HE HAS NO RIGHT WHATSOEVER TO EXPECT OR DEMAND THAT HIS
FELLOW CITIZENS SHOULD CONTINUE TO GIVE HIM THEIR SUPPORT.

HOW LITTLE SUCH A LINE OF CONDUCT COMMENDS ITSELF TO OUR PUBLIC LEADERS
NOWADAYS IS PROVED BY THE GENERAL CORRUPTION PREVALENT AMONG THE CABAL
WHICH AT THE PRESENT MOMENT FEELS ITSELF CALLED TO POLITICAL LEADERSHIP.
IN THE WHOLE CABAL THERE IS SCARCELY ONE WHO IS PROPERLY EQUIPPED FOR
THIS TASK.

ALTHOUGH IN THOSE DAYS I USED TO GIVE MORE TIME THAN MOST OTHERS TO THE
CONSIDERATION OF POLITICAL QUESTION, YET I CAREFULLY REFRAINED FROM
TAKING AN OPEN PART IN POLITICS. ONLY TO A SMALL CIRCLE DID I SPEAK OF
THOSE THINGS WHICH AGITATED MY MIND OR WERE THE CAUSE OF CONSTANT
PREOCCUPATION FOR ME. THE HABIT OF DISCUSSING MATTERS WITHIN SUCH A
RESTRICTED GROUP HAD MANY ADVANTAGES IN ITSELF. RATHER THAN TALK AT
THEM, I LEARNED TO FEEL MY WAY INTO THE MODES OF THOUGHT AND VIEWS OF
THOSE MEN AROUND ME. OFTENTIMES SUCH WAYS OF THINKING AND SUCH VIEWS
WERE QUITE PRIMITIVE. THUS I TOOK EVERY POSSIBLE OCCASION TO INCREASE MY
KNOWLEDGE OF MEN.

NOWHERE AMONG THE GERMAN PEOPLE WAS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MAKING SUCH A
STUDY SO FAVOURABLE AS IN VIENNA.

IN THE OLD DANUBIAN MONARCHY POLITICAL THOUGHT WAS WIDER IN ITS RANGE
AND HAD A RICHER VARIETY OF INTERESTS THAN IN THE GERMANY OF THAT
EPOCH--EXCEPTING CERTAIN PARTS OF PRUSSIA, HAMBURG AND THE DISTRICTS
BORDERING ON THE NORTH SEA. WHEN I SPEAK OF AUSTRIA HERE I MEAN THAT
PART OF THE GREAT HABSBURG EMPIRE WHICH, BY REASON OF ITS GERMAN
POPULATION, FURNISHED NOT ONLY THE HISTORIC BASIS FOR THE FORMATION OF
THIS STATE BUT WHOSE POPULATION WAS FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES ALSO THE
EXCLUSIVE SOURCE OF CULTURAL LIFE IN THAT POLITICAL SYSTEM WHOSE
STRUCTURE WAS SO ARTIFICIAL. AS TIME WENT ON THE STABILITY OF THE
AUSTRIAN STATE AND THE GUARANTEE OF ITS CONTINUED EXISTENCE DEPENDED
MORE AND MORE ON THE MAINTENANCE OF THIS GERM-CELL OF THAT HABSBURG
EMPIRE.

THE HEREDITARY IMPERIAL PROVINCES CONSTITUTED THE HEART OF THE EMPIRE.
AND IT WAS THIS HEART THAT CONSTANTLY SENT THE BLOOD OF LIFE PULSATING
THROUGH THE WHOLE POLITICAL AND CULTURAL SYSTEM. CORRESPONDING TO THE
HEART OF THE EMPIRE, VIENNA SIGNIFIED THE BRAIN AND THE WILL. AT THAT
TIME VIENNA PRESENTED AN APPEARANCE WHICH MADE ONE THINK OF HER AS AN
ENTHRONED QUEEN WHOSE AUTHORITATIVE SWAY UNITED THE CONGLOMERATION OF
HETEROGENOUS NATIONALITIES THAT LIVED UNDER THE HABSBURG SCEPTRE. THE
RADIANT BEAUTY OF THE CAPITAL CITY MADE ONE FORGET THE SAD SYMPTOMS OF
SENILE DECAY WHICH THE STATE MANIFESTED AS A WHOLE.

THOUGH THE EMPIRE WAS INTERNALLY RICKETY BECAUSE OF THE TERRIFIC
CONFLICT GOING ON BETWEEN THE VARIOUS NATIONALITIES, THE OUTSIDE
WORLD--AND GERMANY IN PARTICULAR--SAW ONLY THAT LOVELY PICTURE OF THE
CITY. THE ILLUSION WAS ALL THE GREATER BECAUSE AT THAT TIME VIENNA
SEEMED TO HAVE RISEN TO ITS HIGHEST PITCH OF SPLENDOUR. UNDER A MAYOR,
WHO HAD THE TRUE STAMP OF ADMINISTRATIVE GENIUS, THE VENERABLE
RESIDENTIAL CITY OF THE EMPERORS OF THE OLD EMPIRE SEEMED TO HAVE THE
GLORY OF ITS YOUTH RENEWED. THE LAST GREAT GERMAN WHO SPRANG FROM THE
RANKS OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAD COLONIZED THE EAST MARK WAS NOT A
'STATESMAN', IN THE OFFICIAL SENSE. THIS DR. LUEGAR, HOWEVER, IN HIS
RÃ´LE AS MAYOR OF 'THE IMPERIAL CAPITAL AND RESIDENTIAL CITY', HAD
ACHIEVED SO MUCH IN ALMOST ALL SPHERES OF MUNICIPAL ACTIVITY, WHETHER
ECONOMIC OR CULTURAL, THAT THE HEART OF THE WHOLE EMPIRE THROBBED WITH
RENEWED VIGOUR. HE THUS PROVED HIMSELF A MUCH GREATER STATESMAN THAN THE
SO-CALLED 'DIPLOMATS' OF THAT PERIOD.

THE FACT THAT THIS POLITICAL SYSTEM OF HETEROGENEOUS RACES CALLED
AUSTRIA, FINALLY BROKE DOWN IS NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER OF POLITICAL
INCAPACITY ON THE PART OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT IN THE OLD EAST MARK. THE
COLLAPSE WAS THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION. TEN
MILLION PEOPLE CANNOT PERMANENTLY HOLD TOGETHER A STATE OF FIFTY
MILLIONS, COMPOSED OF DIFFERENT AND CONVICTING NATIONALITIES, UNLESS
CERTAIN DEFINITE PRE-REQUISITE CONDITIONS ARE AT HAND WHILE THERE IS
STILL TIME TO AVAIL OF THEM.

THE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN HAD VERY BIG WAYS OF THINKING. ACCUSTOMED TO LIVE IN
A GREAT EMPIRE, HE HAD A KEEN SENSE OF THE OBLIGATIONS INCUMBENT ON HIM
IN SUCH A SITUATION. HE WAS THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE AUSTRIAN STATE WHO
LOOKED BEYOND THE BORDERS OF THE NARROW LANDS BELONGING TO THE CROWN AND
TOOK IN ALL THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE IN THE SWEEP OF HIS MIND. INDEED
WHEN DESTINY SEVERED HIM FROM THE COMMON FATHERLAND HE TRIED TO MASTER
THE TREMENDOUS TASK WHICH WAS SET BEFORE HIM AS A CONSEQUENCE. THIS TASK
WAS TO MAINTAIN FOR THE GERMAN-AUSTRIANS THAT PATRIMONY WHICH, THROUGH
INNUMERABLE STRUGGLES, THEIR ANCESTORS HAD ORIGINALLY WRESTED FROM THE
EAST. IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE GERMAN-AUSTRIANS COULD NOT PUT
THEIR UNDIVIDED STRENGTH INTO THIS EFFORT, BECAUSE THE HEARTS AND MINDS
OF THE BEST AMONG THEM WERE CONSTANTLY TURNING BACK TOWARDS THEIR
KINSFOLK IN THE MOTHERLAND, SO THAT ONLY A FRACTION OF THEIR ENERGY
REMAINED TO BE EMPLOYED AT HOME.

THE MENTAL HORIZON OF THE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN WAS COMPARATIVELY BROAD. HIS
COMMERCIAL INTERESTS COMPRISED ALMOST EVERY SECTION OF THE HETEROGENEOUS
EMPIRE. THE CONDUCT OF ALMOST ALL IMPORTANT UNDERTAKINGS WAS IN HIS
HANDS. HE PROVIDED THE STATE, FOR THE MOST PART, WITH ITS LEADING
TECHNICAL EXPERTS AND CIVIL SERVANTS. HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR CARRYING ON
THE FOREIGN TRADE OF THE COUNTRY, AS FAR AS THAT SPHERE OF ACTIVITY WAS
NOT UNDER JEWISH CONTROL, THE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN EXCLUSIVELY REPRESENTED
THE POLITICAL CEMENT THAT HELD THE STATE TOGETHER. HIS MILITARY DUTIES
CARRIED HIM FAR BEYOND THE NARROW FRONTIERS OF HIS HOMELAND. THOUGH THE
RECRUIT MIGHT JOIN A REGIMENT MADE UP OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT, THE
REGIMENT ITSELF MIGHT BE STATIONED IN HERZEGOVINA AS WELL AS IN VIENNA
OR GALICIA. THE OFFICERS IN THE HABSBURG ARMIES WERE STILL GERMANS AND
SO WAS THE PREDOMINATING ELEMENT IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF THE CIVIL
SERVICE. ART AND SCIENCE WERE IN GERMAN HANDS. APART FROM THE NEW
ARTISTIC TRASH, WHICH MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY A NEGRO TRIBE,
ALL GENUINE ARTISTIC INSPIRATION CAME FROM THE GERMAN SECTION OF THE
POPULATION. IN MUSIC, ARCHITECTURE, SCULPTURE AND PAINTING, VIENNA
ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED THE ENTIRE DUAL MONARCHY. AND THE SOURCE NEVER
SEEMED TO SHOW SIGNS OF A POSSIBLE EXHAUSTION. FINALLY, IT WAS THE
GERMAN ELEMENT THAT DETERMINED THE CONDUCT OF FOREIGN POLICY, THOUGH A
SMALL NUMBER OF HUNGARIANS WERE ALSO ACTIVE IN THAT FIELD.

ALL EFFORTS, HOWEVER, TO SAVE THE UNITY OF THE STATE WERE DOOMED TO END
IN FAILURE, BECAUSE THE ESSENTIAL PRE-REQUISITES WERE MISSING.

THERE WAS ONLY ONE POSSIBLE WAY TO CONTROL AND HOLD IN CHECK THE
CENTRIFUGAL FORCES OF THE DIFFERENT AND DIFFERING NATIONALITIES. THIS
WAY WAS: TO GOVERN THE AUSTRIAN STATE AND ORGANIZE IT INTERNALLY ON THE
PRINCIPLE OF CENTRALIZATION. IN NO OTHER WAY IMAGINABLE COULD THE
EXISTENCE OF THAT STATE BE ASSURED.

NOW AND AGAIN THERE WERE LUCID INTERVALS IN THE HIGHER RULING QUARTERS
WHEN THIS TRUTH WAS RECOGNIZED. BUT IT WAS SOON FORGOTTEN AGAIN, OR ELSE
DELIBERATELY IGNORED, BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES TO BE OVERCOME IN
PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE. EVERY PROJECT WHICH AIMED AT GIVING THE EMPIRE
A MORE FEDERAL SHAPE WAS BOUND TO BE INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO
STRONG CENTRAL AUTHORITY WHICH COULD EXERCISE SUFFICIENT POWER WITHIN
THE STATE TO HOLD THE FEDERAL ELEMENTS TOGETHER. IT MUST BE REMEMBERED
IN THIS CONNECTION THAT CONDITIONS IN AUSTRIA WERE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM
THOSE WHICH CHARACTERIZED THE GERMAN STATE AS FOUNDED BY BISMARCK.
GERMANY WAS FACED WITH ONLY ONE DIFFICULTY, WHICH WAS THAT OF
TRANSFORMING THE PURELY POLITICAL TRADITIONS, BECAUSE THROUGHOUT THE
WHOLE OF BISMARCK'S GERMANY THERE WAS A COMMON CULTURAL BASIS. THE
GERMAN EMPIRE CONTAINED ONLY MEMBERS OF ONE AND THE SAME RACIAL OR
NATIONAL STOCK, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW MINOR FOREIGN FRAGMENTS.

DEMOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS IN AUSTRIA WERE QUITE THE REVERSE. WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF HUNGARY THERE WAS NO POLITICAL TRADITION, COMING DOWN FROM
A GREAT PAST, IN ANY OF THE VARIOUS AFFILIATED COUNTRIES. IF THERE HAD
BEEN, TIME HAD EITHER WIPED OUT ALL TRACES OF IT, OR AT LEAST, RENDERED
THEM OBSCURE. MOREOVER, THIS WAS THE EPOCH WHEN THE PRINCIPLE OF
NATIONALITY BEGAN TO BE IN ASCENDANT; AND THAT PHENOMENON AWAKENED THE
NATIONAL INSTINCTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES AFFILIATED UNDER THE
HABSBURG SCEPTRE. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THE ACTION OF THESE NEWLY
AWAKENED NATIONAL FORCES; BECAUSE, ADJACENT TO THE FRONTIERS OF THE DUAL
MONARCHY, NEW NATIONAL STATES WERE SPRINGING UP WHOSE PEOPLE WERE OF THE
SAME OR KINDRED RACIAL STOCK AS THE RESPECTIVE NATIONALITIES THAT
CONSTITUTED THE HABSBURG EMPIRE. THESE NEW STATES WERE ABLE TO EXERCISE
A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN THE GERMAN ELEMENT.

EVEN VIENNA COULD NOT HOLD OUT FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD IN THIS CONFLICT.
WHEN BUDAPEST HAD DEVELOPED INTO A METROPOLIS A RIVAL HAD GROWN UP WHOSE
MISSION WAS, NOT TO HELP IN HOLDING TOGETHER THE VARIOUS DIVERGENT PARTS
OF THE EMPIRE, BUT RATHER TO STRENGTHEN ONE PART. WITHIN A SHORT TIME
PRAGUE FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE OF BUDAPEST; AND LATER ON CAME LEMBERG,
LAIBACH AND OTHERS. BY RAISING THESE PLACES WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN
PROVINCIAL TOWNS TO THE RANK OF NATIONAL CITIES, RALLYING CENTRES WERE
PROVIDED FOR AN INDEPENDENT CULTURAL LIFE. THROUGH THIS THE LOCAL
NATIONAL INSTINCTS ACQUIRED A SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION AND THEREWITH GAINED
A MORE PROFOUND HOLD ON THE PEOPLE. THE TIME WAS BOUND TO COME WHEN THE
PARTICULARIST INTERESTS OF THOSE VARIOUS COUNTRIES WOULD BECOME STRONGER
THAN THEIR COMMON IMPERIAL INTERESTS. ONCE THAT STAGE HAD BEEN REACHED,
AUSTRIA'S DOOM WAS SEALED.

THE COURSE OF THIS DEVELOPMENT WAS CLEARLY PERCEPTIBLE SINCE THE DEATH
OF JOSEPH II. ITS RAPIDITY DEPENDED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, SOME OF
WHICH HAD THEIR SOURCE IN THE MONARCHY ITSELF; WHILE OTHERS RESULTED
FROM THE POSITION WHICH THE EMPIRE HAD TAKEN IN FOREIGN POLITICS.

IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE ANYTHING LIKE A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT FOR THE
PERMANENT CONSOLIDATION OF THE AUSTRIAN STATE UNLESS A FIRM AND
PERSISTENT POLICY OF CENTRALIZATION WERE PUT INTO FORCE. BEFORE
EVERYTHING ELSE THE PRINCIPLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADOPTED THAT ONLY ONE
COMMON LANGUAGE COULD BE USED AS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF THE STATE.
THUS IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO EMPHASIZE THE FORMAL UNITY OF THAT IMPERIAL
COMMONWEALTH. AND THUS THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD HAVE IN ITS HANDS A
TECHNICAL INSTRUMENT WITHOUT WHICH THE STATE COULD NOT ENDURE AS A
POLITICAL UNITY. IN THE SAME WAY THE SCHOOL AND OTHER FORMS OF EDUCATION
SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO INCULCATE A FEELING OF COMMON CITIZENSHIP. SUCH
AN OBJECTIVE COULD NOT BE REACHED WITHIN TEN OR TWENTY YEARS. THE EFFORT
WOULD HAVE TO BE ENVISAGED IN TERMS OF CENTURIES; JUST AS IN ALL
PROBLEMS OF COLONIZATION, STEADY PERSEVERANCE IS A FAR MORE IMPORTANT
ELEMENT THAN THE OUTPUT OF ENERGETIC EFFORT AT THE MOMENT.

IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE COUNTRY MUST BE
GOVERNED AND ADMINISTERED BY STRICTLY ADHERING TO THE PRINCIPLE OF
UNIFORMITY.

FOR ME IT WAS QUITE INSTRUCTIVE TO DISCOVER WHY THIS DID NOT TAKE PLACE,
OR RATHER WHY IT WAS NOT DONE. THOSE WHO WERE GUILTY OF THE OMISSION
MUST BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BREAK-UP OF THE HABSBURG EMPIRE.

MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE, THE EXISTENCE OF THE OLD AUSTRIA DEPENDED ON
A STRONG AND CAPABLE GOVERNMENT. THE HABSBURG EMPIRE LACKED ETHNICAL
UNIFORMITY, WHICH CONSTITUTES THE FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF A NATIONAL STATE
AND WILL PRESERVE THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A STATE EVEN THOUGH THE RULING
POWER SHOULD BE GROSSLY INEFFICIENT. WHEN A STATE IS COMPOSED OF A
HOMOGENEOUS POPULATION, THE NATURAL INERTIA OF SUCH A POPULATION WILL
HOLD THE STAGE TOGETHER AND MAINTAIN ITS EXISTENCE THROUGH ASTONISHINGLY
LONG PERIODS OF MISGOVERNMENT AND MALADMINISTRATION. IT MAY OFTEN SEEM
AS IF THE PRINCIPLE OF LIFE HAD DIED OUT IN SUCH A BODY-POLITIC; BUT A
TIME COMES WHEN THE APPARENT CORPSE RISES UP AND DISPLAYS BEFORE THE
WORLD AN ASTONISHING MANIFESTATION OF ITS INDESTRUCTIBLE VITALITY.

BUT THE SITUATION IS UTTERLY DIFFERENT IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE POPULATION
IS NOT HOMOGENEOUS, WHERE THERE IS NO BOND OF COMMON BLOOD BUT ONLY THAT
OF ONE RULING HAND. SHOULD THE RULING HAND SHOW SIGNS OF WEAKNESS IN
SUCH A STATE THE RESULT WILL NOT BE TO CAUSE A KIND OF HIBERNATION OF
THE STATE BUT RATHER TO AWAKEN THE INDIVIDUALIST INSTINCTS WHICH ARE
SLUMBERING IN THE ETHNOLOGICAL GROUPS. THESE INSTINCTS DO NOT MAKE
THEMSELVES FELT AS LONG AS THESE GROUPS ARE DOMINATED BY A STRONG
CENTRAL WILL-TO-GOVERN. THE DANGER WHICH EXISTS IN THESE SLUMBERING
SEPARATIST INSTINCTS CAN BE RENDERED MORE OR LESS INNOCUOUS ONLY THROUGH
CENTURIES OF COMMON EDUCATION, COMMON TRADITIONS AND COMMON INTERESTS.
THE YOUNGER SUCH STATES ARE, THE MORE THEIR EXISTENCE WILL DEPEND ON THE
ABILITY AND STRENGTH OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. IF THEIR FOUNDATION WAS
DUE ONLY TO THE WORK OF A STRONG PERSONALITY OR A LEADER WHO IS A MAN OF
GENIUS, IN MANY CASES THEY WILL BREAK UP AS SOON AS THE FOUNDER
DISAPPEARS; BECAUSE, THOUGH GREAT, HE STOOD ALONE. BUT EVEN AFTER
CENTURIES OF A COMMON EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCES THESE SEPARATIST
INSTINCTS I HAVE SPOKEN OF ARE NOT ALWAYS COMPLETELY OVERCOME. THEY MAY
BE ONLY DORMANT AND MAY SUDDENLY AWAKEN WHEN THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
SHOWS WEAKNESS AND THE FORCE OF A COMMON EDUCATION AS WELL AS THE
PRESTIGE OF A COMMON TRADITION PROVE UNABLE TO WITHSTAND THE VITAL
ENERGIES OF SEPARATIST NATIONALITIES FORGING AHEAD TOWARDS THE SHAPING
OF THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL EXISTENCE.

THE FAILURE TO SEE THE TRUTH OF ALL THIS CONSTITUTED WHAT MAY BE CALLED
THE TRAGIC CRIME OF THE HABSBURG RULERS.

ONLY BEFORE THE EYES OF ONE HABSBURG RULER, AND THAT FOR THE LAST TIME,
DID THE HAND OF DESTINY HOLD ALOFT THE TORCH THAT THREW LIGHT ON THE
FUTURE OF HIS COUNTRY. BUT THE TORCH WAS THEN EXTINGUISHED FOR EVER.

JOSEPH II, ROMAN EMPEROR OF THE GERMAN NATION, WAS FILLED WITH A GROWING
ANXIETY WHEN HE REALIZED THE FACT THAT HIS HOUSE WAS REMOVED TO AN
OUTLYING FRONTIER OF HIS EMPIRE AND THAT THE TIME WOULD SOON BE AT HAND
WHEN IT WOULD BE OVERTURNED AND ENGULFED IN THE WHIRLPOOL CAUSED BY THAT
BABYLON OF NATIONALITIES, UNLESS SOMETHING WAS DONE AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR
TO OVERCOME THE DIRE CONSEQUENCES RESULTING FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OF HIS
ANCESTORS. WITH SUPERHUMAN ENERGY THIS 'FRIEND OF MANKIND' MADE EVERY
POSSIBLE EFFORT TO COUNTERACT THE EFFECTS OF THE CARELESSNESS AND
THOUGHTLESSNESS OF HIS PREDECESSORS. WITHIN ONE DECADE HE STROVE TO
REPAIR THE DAMAGE THAT HAD BEEN DONE THROUGH CENTURIES. IF DESTINY HAD
ONLY GRANTED HIM FORTY YEARS FOR HIS LABOURS, AND IF ONLY TWO
GENERATIONS HAD CARRIED ON THE WORK WHICH HE HAD STARTED, THE MIRACLE
MIGHT HAVE BEEN PERFORMED. BUT WHEN HE DIED, BROKEN IN BODY AND SPIRIT
AFTER TEN YEARS OF RULERSHIP, HIS WORK SANK WITH HIM INTO THE GRAVE AND
RESTS WITH HIM THERE IN THE CAPUCIN CRYPT, SLEEPING ITS ETERNAL SLEEP,
HAVING NEVER AGAIN SHOWED SIGNS OF AWAKENING.

HIS SUCCESSORS HAD NEITHER THE ABILITY NOR THE WILL-POWER NECESSARY FOR
THE TASK THEY HAD TO FACE.

WHEN THE FIRST SIGNS OF A NEW REVOLUTIONARY EPOCH APPEARED IN EUROPE
THEY GRADUALLY SCATTERED THE FIRE THROUGHOUT AUSTRIA. AND WHEN THE FIRE
BEGAN TO GLOW STEADILY IT WAS FED AND FANNED NOT BY THE SOCIAL OR
POLITICAL CONDITIONS BUT BY FORCES THAT HAD THEIR ORIGIN IN THE
NATIONALIST YEARNINGS OF THE VARIOUS ETHNIC GROUPS.

THE EUROPEAN REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT OF 1848 PRIMARILY TOOK THE FORM OF A
CLASS CONFLICT IN ALMOST EVERY OTHER COUNTRY, BUT IN AUSTRIA IT TOOK THE
FORM OF A NEW RACIAL STRUGGLE. IN SO FAR AS THE GERMAN-AUSTRIANS THERE
FORGOT THE ORIGINS OF THE MOVEMENT, OR PERHAPS HAD FAILED TO RECOGNIZE
THEM AT THE START AND CONSEQUENTLY TOOK PART IN THE REVOLUTIONARY
UPRISING, THEY SEALED THEIR OWN FATE. FOR THEY THUS HELPED TO AWAKEN THE
SPIRIT OF WESTERN DEMOCRACY WHICH, WITHIN A SHORT WHILE, SHATTERED THE
FOUNDATIONS OF THEIR OWN EXISTENCE.

THE SETTING UP OF A REPRESENTATIVE PARLIAMENTARY BODY, WITHOUT INSISTING
ON THE PRELIMINARY THAT ONLY ONE LANGUAGE SHOULD BE USED IN ALL PUBLIC
INTERCOURSE UNDER THE STATE, WAS THE FIRST GREAT BLOW TO THE
PREDOMINANCE OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT IN THE DUAL MONARCHY. FROM THAT
MOMENT THE STATE WAS ALSO DOOMED TO COLLAPSE SOONER OR LATER. ALL THAT
FOLLOWED WAS NOTHING BUT THE HISTORICAL LIQUIDATION OF AN EMPIRE.

TO WATCH THAT PROCESS OF PROGRESSIVE DISINTEGRATION WAS A TRAGIC AND AT
THE SAME TIME AN INSTRUCTIVE EXPERIENCE. THE EXECUTION OF HISTORY'S
DECREE WAS CARRIED OUT IN THOUSANDS OF DETAILS. THE FACT THAT GREAT
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WENT ABOUT BLINDFOLDED AMID THE MANIFEST SIGNS OF
DISSOLUTION ONLY PROVES THAT THE GODS HAD DECREED THE DESTRUCTION OF
AUSTRIA.

I DO NOT WISH TO DWELL ON DETAILS BECAUSE THAT WOULD LIE OUTSIDE THE
SCOPE OF THIS BOOK. I WANT TO TREAT IN DETAIL ONLY THOSE EVENTS WHICH
ARE TYPICAL AMONG THE CAUSES THAT LEAD TO THE DECLINE OF NATIONS AND
STATES AND WHICH ARE THEREFORE OF IMPORTANCE TO OUR PRESENT AGE.
MOREOVER, THE STUDY OF THESE EVENTS HELPED TO FURNISH THE BASIS OF MY
OWN POLITICAL OUTLOOK.

AMONG THE INSTITUTIONS WHICH MOST CLEARLY MANIFESTED UNMISTAKABLE SIGNS
OF DECAY, EVEN TO THE WEAK-SIGHTED PHILISTINE, WAS THAT WHICH, OF ALL
THE INSTITUTIONS OF STATE, OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE MOST FIRMLY FOUNDED--I
MEAN THE PARLIAMENT, OR THE REICHSRAT (IMPERIAL COUNCIL) AS IT WAS
CALLED IN AUSTRIA.

THE PATTERN FOR THIS CORPORATE BODY WAS OBVIOUSLY THAT WHICH EXISTED IN
ENGLAND, THE LAND OF CLASSIC DEMOCRACY. THE WHOLE OF THAT EXCELLENT
ORGANIZATION WAS BODILY TRANSFERRED TO AUSTRIA WITH AS LITTLE ALTERATION
AS POSSIBLE.

AS THE AUSTRIAN COUNTERPART TO THE BRITISH TWO-CHAMBER SYSTEM A CHAMBER
OF DEPUTIES AND A HOUSE OF LORDS (HERRENHAUS) WERE ESTABLISHED IN
VIENNA. THE HOUSES THEMSELVES, CONSIDERED AS BUILDINGS WERE SOMEWHAT
DIFFERENT. WHEN BARRY BUILT HIS PALACES, OR, AS WE SAY THE HOUSES OF
PARLIAMENT, ON THE SHORE OF THE THAMES, HE COULD LOOK TO THE HISTORY OF
THE BRITISH EMPIRE FOR THE INSPIRATION OF HIS WORK. IN THAT HISTORY HE
FOUND SUFFICIENT MATERIAL TO FILL AND DECORATE THE 1,200 NICHES,
BRACKETS, AND PILLARS OF HIS MAGNIFICENT EDIFICE. HIS STATUES AND
PAINTINGS MADE THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TEMPLES
DEDICATED TO THE GLORY OF THE NATION.

THERE IT WAS THAT VIENNA ENCOUNTERED THE FIRST DIFFICULTY. WHEN HANSEN,
THE DANISH ARCHITECT, HAD COMPLETED THE LAST GABLE OF THE MARBLE PALACE
IN WHICH THE NEW BODY OF POPULAR REPRESENTATIVES WAS TO BE HOUSED HE HAD
TO TURN TO THE ANCIENT CLASSICAL WORLD FOR SUBJECTS TO FILL OUT HIS
DECORATIVE PLAN. THIS THEATRICAL SHRINE OF 'WESTERN DEMOCRACY' WAS
ADORNED WITH THE STATUES AND PORTRAITS OF GREEK AND ROMAN STATESMEN AND
PHILOSOPHERS. AS IF IT WERE MEANT FOR A SYMBOL OF IRONY, THE HORSES OF
THE QUADRIGA THAT SURMOUNTS THE TWO HOUSES ARE PULLING APART FROM ONE
ANOTHER TOWARDS ALL FOUR QUARTERS OF THE GLOBE. THERE COULD BE NO BETTER
SYMBOL FOR THE KIND OF ACTIVITY GOING ON WITHIN THE WALLS OF THAT SAME
BUILDING.

THE 'NATIONALITIES' WERE OPPOSED TO ANY KIND OF GLORIFICATION OF
AUSTRIAN HISTORY IN THE DECORATION OF THIS BUILDING, INSISTING THAT SUCH
WOULD CONSTITUTE AN OFFENCE TO THEM AND A PROVOCATION. MUCH THE SAME
HAPPENED IN GERMANY, WHERE THE REICH-STAG, BUILT BY WALLOT, WAS NOT
DEDICATED TO THE GERMAN PEOPLE UNTIL THE CANNONS WERE THUNDERING IN THE
WORLD WAR. AND THEN IT WAS DEDICATED BY AN INSCRIPTION.

I WAS NOT YET TWENTY YEARS OF AGE WHEN I FIRST ENTERED THE PALACE ON THE
FRANZENS-RING TO WATCH AND LISTEN IN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES. THAT FIRST
EXPERIENCE AROUSED IN ME A PROFOUND FEELING OF REPUGNANCE.

I HAD ALWAYS HATED THE PARLIAMENT, BUT NOT AS AN INSTITUTION IN ITSELF.
QUITE THE CONTRARY. AS ONE WHO CHERISHED IDEALS OF POLITICAL FREEDOM I
COULD NOT EVEN IMAGINE ANY OTHER FORM OF GOVERNMENT. IN THE LIGHT OF MY
ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG I SHOULD THEN HAVE CONSIDERED IT
A CRIME AGAINST LIBERTY AND REASON TO THINK OF ANY KIND OF DICTATORSHIP
AS A POSSIBLE FORM OF GOVERNMENT.

A CERTAIN ADMIRATION WHICH I HAD FOR THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT CONTRIBUTED
TOWARDS THE FORMATION OF THIS OPINION. I BECAME IMBUED WITH THAT FEELING
OF ADMIRATION ALMOST WITHOUT MY BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE EFFECT OF IT
THROUGH SO MUCH READING OF NEWSPAPERS WHILE I WAS YET QUITE YOUNG. I
COULD NOT DISCARD THAT ADMIRATION ALL IN A MOMENT. THE DIGNIFIED WAY IN
WHICH THE BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS FULFILLED ITS FUNCTION IMPRESSED ME
GREATLY, THANKS LARGELY TO THE GLOWING TERMS IN WHICH THE AUSTRIAN PRESS
REPORTED THESE EVENTS. I USED TO ASK MYSELF WHETHER THERE COULD BE ANY
NOBLER FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAN SELF-GOVERNMENT BY THE PEOPLE.

BUT THESE CONSIDERATIONS FURNISHED THE VERY MOTIVES OF MY HOSTILITY TO
THE AUSTRIAN PARLIAMENT. THE FORM IN WHICH PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT WAS
HERE REPRESENTED SEEMED UNWORTHY OF ITS GREAT PROTOTYPE. THE FOLLOWING
CONSIDERATIONS ALSO INFLUENCED MY ATTITUDE:

THE FATE OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT IN THE AUSTRIAN STATE DEPENDED ON ITS
POSITION IN PARLIAMENT. UP TO THE TIME THAT UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE BY SECRET
BALLOT WAS INTRODUCED THE GERMAN REPRESENTATIVES HAD A MAJORITY IN THE
PARLIAMENT, THOUGH THAT MAJORITY WAS NOT A VERY SUBSTANTIAL ONE. THIS
SITUATION GAVE CAUSE FOR ANXIETY BECAUSE THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC FRACTION
OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT COULD NOT BE RELIED UPON WHEN NATIONAL QUESTIONS
WERE AT STAKE. IN MATTERS THAT WERE OF CRITICAL CONCERN FOR THE GERMAN
ELEMENT, THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS ALWAYS TOOK UP AN ANTI-GERMAN STAND
BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF LOSING THEIR FOLLOWERS AMONG THE OTHER
NATIONAL GROUPS. ALREADY AT THAT TIME--BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF
UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE--THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC PARTY COULD NO LONGER BE
CONSIDERED AS A GERMAN PARTY. THE INTRODUCTION OF UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE PUT
AN END EVEN TO THE PURELY NUMERICAL PREDOMINANCE OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT.
THE WAY WAS NOW CLEAR FOR THE FURTHER 'DE-GERMANIZATION' OF THE AUSTRIAN
STATE.

THE NATIONAL INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO
WELCOME A REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM IN WHICH THE GERMAN ELEMENT WAS NOT
REALLY REPRESENTED AS SUCH, BUT ALWAYS BETRAYED BY THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC
FRACTION. YET ALL THESE, AND MANY OTHERS, WERE DEFECTS WHICH COULD NOT
BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM AS SUCH, BUT RATHER TO THE
AUSTRIAN STATE IN PARTICULAR. I STILL BELIEVED THAT IF THE GERMAN
MAJORITY COULD BE RESTORED IN THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY THERE WOULD BE NO
OCCASION TO OPPOSE SUCH A SYSTEM AS LONG AS THE OLD AUSTRIAN STATE
CONTINUED TO EXIST.

SUCH WAS MY GENERAL ATTITUDE AT THE TIME WHEN I FIRST ENTERED THOSE
SACRED AND CONTENTIOUS HALLS. FOR ME THEY WERE SACRED ONLY BECAUSE OF
THE RADIANT BEAUTY OF THAT MAJESTIC EDIFICE. A GREEK WONDER ON GERMAN
SOIL.

BUT I SOON BECAME ENRAGED BY THE HIDEOUS SPECTACLE THAT MET MY EYES.
SEVERAL HUNDRED REPRESENTATIVES WERE THERE TO DISCUSS A PROBLEM OF GREAT
ECONOMICAL IMPORTANCE AND EACH REPRESENTATIVE HAD THE RIGHT TO HAVE HIS
SAY.

THAT EXPERIENCE OF A DAY WAS ENOUGH TO SUPPLY ME WITH FOOD FOR THOUGHT
DURING SEVERAL WEEKS AFTERWARDS.

THE INTELLECTUAL LEVEL OF THE DEBATE WAS QUITE LOW. SOME TIMES THE
DEBATERS DID NOT MAKE THEMSELVES INTELLIGIBLE AT ALL. SEVERAL OF THOSE
PRESENT DID NOT SPEAK GERMAN BUT ONLY THEIR SLAV VERNACULARS OR
DIALECTS. THUS I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HEARING WITH MY OWN EARS WHAT I
HAD BEEN HITHERTO ACQUAINTED WITH ONLY THROUGH READING THE NEWSPAPERS. A
TURBULENT MASS OF PEOPLE, ALL GESTICULATING AND BAWLING AGAINST ONE
ANOTHER, WITH A PATHETIC OLD MAN SHAKING HIS BELL AND MAKING FRANTIC
EFFORTS TO CALL THE HOUSE TO A SENSE OF ITS DIGNITY BY FRIENDLY APPEALS,
EXHORTATIONS, AND GRAVE WARNINGS.

I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM LAUGHING.

SEVERAL WEEKS LATER I PAID A SECOND VISIT. THIS TIME THE HOUSE PRESENTED
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PICTURE, SO MUCH SO THAT ONE COULD HARDLY
RECOGNIZE IT AS THE SAME PLACE. THE HALL WAS PRACTICALLY EMPTY. THEY
WERE SLEEPING IN THE OTHER ROOMS BELOW. ONLY A FEW DEPUTIES WERE IN
THEIR PLACES, YAWNING IN EACH OTHER'S FACES. ONE WAS SPEECHIFYING. A
DEPUTY SPEAKER WAS IN THE CHAIR. WHEN HE LOOKED ROUND IT WAS QUITE PLAIN
THAT HE FELT BORED.

THEN I BEGAN TO REFLECT SERIOUSLY ON THE WHOLE THING. I WENT TO THE
PARLIAMENT WHENEVER I HAD ANY TIME TO SPARE AND WATCHED THE SPECTACLE
SILENTLY BUT ATTENTIVELY. I LISTENED TO THE DEBATES, AS FAR AS THEY
COULD BE UNDERSTOOD, AND I STUDIED THE MORE OR LESS INTELLIGENT FEATURES
OF THOSE 'ELECT' REPRESENTATIVES OF THE VARIOUS NATIONALITIES WHICH
COMPOSED THAT MOTLEY STATE. GRADUALLY I FORMED MY OWN IDEAS ABOUT WHAT I
SAW.

A YEAR OF SUCH QUIET OBSERVATION WAS SUFFICIENT TO TRANSFORM OR
COMPLETELY DESTROY MY FORMER CONVICTIONS AS TO THE CHARACTER OF THIS
PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTION. I NO LONGER OPPOSED MERELY THE PERVERTED FORM
WHICH THE PRINCIPLE OF PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION HAD ASSUMED IN
AUSTRIA. NO. IT HAD BECOME IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO ACCEPT THE SYSTEM IN
ITSELF. UP TO THAT TIME I HAD BELIEVED THAT THE DISASTROUS DEFICIENCIES
OF THE AUSTRIAN PARLIAMENT WERE DUE TO THE LACK OF A GERMAN MAJORITY,
BUT NOW I RECOGNIZED THAT THE INSTITUTION ITSELF WAS WRONG IN ITS VERY
ESSENCE AND FORM.

A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS PRESENTED THEMSELVES BEFORE MY MIND. I STUDIED MORE
CLOSELY THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE OF 'DECISION BY THE MAJORITY VOTE', AND
I SCRUTINIZED NO LESS CAREFULLY THE INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL WORTH OF THE
GENTLEMEN WHO, AS THE CHOSEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION, WERE
ENTRUSTED WITH THE TASK OF MAKING THIS INSTITUTION FUNCTION.

THUS IT HAPPENED THAT AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME I CAME TO KNOW THE
INSTITUTION ITSELF AND THOSE OF WHOM IT WAS COMPOSED. AND IT WAS THUS
THAT, WITHIN THE COURSE OF A FEW YEARS, I CAME TO FORM A CLEAR AND VIVID
PICTURE OF THE AVERAGE TYPE OF THAT MOST LIGHTLY WORSHIPPED PHENOMENON
OF OUR TIME--THE PARLIAMENTARY DEPUTY. THE PICTURE OF HIM WHICH I THEN
FORMED BECAME DEEPLY ENGRAVED ON MY MIND AND I HAVE NEVER ALTERED IT
SINCE, AT LEAST AS FAR AS ESSENTIALS GO.

ONCE AGAIN THESE OBJECT-LESSONS TAKEN FROM REAL LIFE SAVED ME FROM
GETTING FIRMLY ENTANGLED BY A THEORY WHICH AT FIRST SIGHT SEEMS SO
ALLURING TO MANY PEOPLE, THOUGH THAT THEORY ITSELF IS A SYMPTOM OF HUMAN
DECADENCE.

DEMOCRACY, AS PRACTISED IN WESTERN EUROPE TO-DAY, IS THE FORE-RUNNER OF
MARXISM. IN FACT, THE LATTER WOULD NOT BE CONCEIVABLE WITHOUT THE
FORMER. DEMOCRACY IS THE BREEDING-GROUND IN WHICH THE BACILLI OF THE
MARXIST WORLD PEST CAN GROW AND SPREAD. BY THE INTRODUCTION OF
PARLIAMENTARIANISM, DEMOCRACY PRODUCED AN ABORTION OF FILTH AND FIRE
(NOTE 6), THE CREATIVE FIRE OF WHICH, HOWEVER, SEEMS TO HAVE DIED OUT.

[NOTE 6. SPOTTGEBURT VON DRECK UND FEUER. THIS IS THE EPITHET THAT FAUST
HURLS AT MEPHISTOPHELES AS THE LATTER INTRUDES ON THE CONVERSATION
BETWEEN FAUST AND MARTHA IN THE GARDEN:

MEPHISTOPHELES: THOU, FULL OF SENSUAL, SUPER-SENSUAL DESIRE,
                A GIRL BY THE NOSE IS LEADING THEE.
FAUST: ABORTION, THOU OF FILTH AND FIRE.]

I AM MORE THAN GRATEFUL TO FATE THAT THIS PROBLEM CAME TO MY NOTICE WHEN
I WAS STILL IN VIENNA; FOR IF I HAD BEEN IN GERMANY AT THAT TIME I MIGHT
EASILY HAVE FOUND ONLY A SUPERFICIAL SOLUTION. IF I HAD BEEN IN BERLIN
WHEN I FIRST DISCOVERED WHAT AN ILLOGICAL THING THIS INSTITUTION IS
WHICH WE CALL PARLIAMENT, I MIGHT EASILY HAVE GONE TO THE OTHER EXTREME
AND BELIEVED--AS MANY PEOPLE BELIEVED, AND APPARENTLY NOT WITHOUT GOOD
REASON--THAT THE SALVATION OF THE PEOPLE AND THE EMPIRE COULD BE SECURED
ONLY BY RESTRENGTHENING THE PRINCIPLE OF IMPERIAL AUTHORITY. THOSE WHO
HAD THIS BELIEF DID NOT DISCERN THE TENDENCIES OF THEIR TIME AND WERE
BLIND TO THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE PEOPLE.

IN AUSTRIA ONE COULD NOT BE SO EASILY MISLED. THERE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO
FALL FROM ONE ERROR INTO ANOTHER. IF THE PARLIAMENT WERE WORTHLESS, THE
HABSBURGS WERE WORSE; OR AT LEAST NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE BETTER.
THE PROBLEM WAS NOT SOLVED BY REJECTING THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM.
IMMEDIATELY THE QUESTION AROSE: WHAT THEN? TO REPUDIATE AND ABOLISH THE
VIENNA PARLIAMENT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN LEAVING ALL POWER IN THE HANDS
OF THE HABSBURGS. FOR ME, ESPECIALLY, THAT IDEA WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

SINCE THIS PROBLEM WAS SPECIALLY DIFFICULT IN REGARD TO AUSTRIA, I WAS
FORCED WHILE STILL QUITE YOUNG TO GO INTO THE ESSENTIALS OF THE WHOLE
QUESTION MORE THOROUGHLY THAN I OTHERWISE SHOULD HAVE DONE.

THE ASPECT OF THE SITUATION THAT FIRST MADE THE MOST STRIKING IMPRESSION
ON ME AND GAVE ME GROUNDS FOR SERIOUS REFLECTION WAS THE MANIFEST LACK
OF ANY INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY.

THE PARLIAMENT PASSES SOME ACTS OR DECREE WHICH MAY HAVE THE MOST
DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES, YET NOBODY BEARS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.
NOBODY CAN BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT. FOR SURELY ONE CANNOT SAY THAT A
CABINET DISCHARGES ITS RESPONSIBILITY WHEN IT RETIRES AFTER HAVING
BROUGHT ABOUT A CATASTROPHE. OR CAN WE SAY THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY IS
FULLY DISCHARGED WHEN A NEW COALITION IS FORMED OR PARLIAMENT DISSOLVED?
CAN THE PRINCIPLE OF RESPONSIBILITY MEAN ANYTHING ELSE THAN THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF A DEFINITE PERSON?

IS IT AT ALL POSSIBLE ACTUALLY TO CALL TO ACCOUNT THE LEADERS OF A
PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT FOR ANY KIND OF ACTION WHICH ORIGINATED IN THE
WISHES OF THE WHOLE MULTITUDE OF DEPUTIES AND WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER
THEIR ORDERS OR SANCTION? INSTEAD OF DEVELOPING CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS AND
PLANS, DOES THE BUSINESS OF A STATESMAN CONSIST IN THE ART OF MAKING A
WHOLE PACK OF BLOCKHEADS UNDERSTAND HIS PROJECTS? IS IT HIS BUSINESS TO
ENTREAT AND COACH THEM SO THAT THEY WILL GRANT HIM THEIR GENEROUS
CONSENT?

IS IT AN INDISPENSABLE QUALITY IN A STATESMAN THAT HE SHOULD POSSESS A
GIFT OF PERSUASION COMMENSURATE WITH THE STATESMAN'S ABILITY TO CONCEIVE
GREAT POLITICAL MEASURES AND CARRY THEM THROUGH INTO PRACTICE?

DOES IT REALLY PROVE THAT A STATESMAN IS INCOMPETENT IF HE SHOULD FAIL
TO WIN OVER A MAJORITY OF VOTES TO SUPPORT HIS POLICY IN AN ASSEMBLY
WHICH HAS BEEN CALLED TOGETHER AS THE CHANCE RESULT OF AN ELECTORAL
SYSTEM THAT IS NOT ALWAYS HONESTLY ADMINISTERED.

HAS THERE EVER BEEN A CASE WHERE SUCH AN ASSEMBLY HAS WORTHILY APPRAISED
A GREAT POLITICAL CONCEPT BEFORE THAT CONCEPT WAS PUT INTO PRACTICE AND
ITS GREATNESS OPENLY DEMONSTRATED THROUGH ITS SUCCESS?

IN THIS WORLD IS NOT THE CREATIVE ACT OF THE GENIUS ALWAYS A PROTEST
AGAINST THE INERTIA OF THE MASS?

WHAT SHALL THE STATESMAN DO IF HE DOES NOT SUCCEED IN COAXING THE
PARLIAMENTARY MULTITUDE TO GIVE ITS CONSENT TO HIS POLICY? SHALL HE
PURCHASE THAT CONSENT FOR SOME SORT OF CONSIDERATION?

OR, WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THE OBSTINATE STUPIDITY OF HIS FELLOW CITIZENS,
SHOULD HE THEN REFRAIN FROM PUSHING FORWARD THE MEASURES WHICH HE DEEMS
TO BE OF VITAL NECESSITY TO THE LIFE OF THE NATION? SHOULD HE RETIRE OR
REMAIN IN POWER?

IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES DOES NOT A MAN OF CHARACTER FIND HIMSELF FACE TO
FACE WITH AN INSOLUBLE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN HIS OWN POLITICAL INSIGHT
ON THE ONE HAND AND, ON THE OTHER, HIS MORAL INTEGRITY, OR, BETTER
STILL, HIS SENSE OF HONESTY?

WHERE CAN WE DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN PUBLIC DUTY AND PERSONAL HONOUR?

MUST NOT EVERY GENUINE LEADER RENOUNCE THE IDEA OF DEGRADING HIMSELF TO
THE LEVEL OF A POLITICAL JOBBER?

AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, DOES NOT EVERY JOBBER FEEL THE ITCH TO 'PLAY
POLITICS', SEEING THAT THE FINAL RESPONSIBILITY WILL NEVER REST WITH HIM
PERSONALLY BUT WITH AN ANONYMOUS MASS WHICH CAN NEVER BE CALLED TO
ACCOUNT FOR THEIR DEEDS?

MUST NOT OUR PARLIAMENTARY PRINCIPLE OF GOVERNMENT BY NUMERICAL MAJORITY
NECESSARILY LEAD TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEADERSHIP?

DOES ANYBODY HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT HUMAN PROGRESS ORIGINATES IN THE
COMPOSITE BRAIN OF THE MAJORITY AND NOT IN THE BRAIN OF THE INDIVIDUAL
PERSONALITY?

OR MAY IT BE PRESUMED THAT FOR THE FUTURE HUMAN CIVILIZATION WILL BE
ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH THIS AS A CONDITION OF ITS EXISTENCE?

BUT MAY IT NOT BE THAT, TO-DAY, MORE THAN EVER BEFORE, THE CREATIVE
BRAIN OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS INDISPENSABLE?

THE PARLIAMENTARY PRINCIPLE OF VESTING LEGISLATIVE POWER IN THE DECISION
OF THE MAJORITY REJECTS THE AUTHORITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND PUTS A
NUMERICAL QUOTA OF ANONYMOUS HEADS IN ITS PLACE. IN DOING SO IT
CONTRADICTS THE ARISTROCRATIC PRINCIPLE, WHICH IS A FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF
NATURE; BUT, OF COURSE, WE MUST REMEMBER THAT IN THIS DECADENT ERA OF
OURS THE ARISTROCRATIC PRINCIPLE NEED NOT BE THOUGHT OF AS INCORPORATED
IN THE UPPER TEN THOUSAND.

THE DEVASTATING INFLUENCE OF THIS PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTION MIGHT NOT
EASILY BE RECOGNIZED BY THOSE WHO READ THE JEWISH PRESS, UNLESS THE
READER HAS LEARNED HOW TO THINK INDEPENDENTLY AND EXAMINE THE FACTS FOR
HIMSELF. THIS INSTITUTION IS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CROWDED
INRUSH OF MEDIOCRE PEOPLE INTO THE FIELD OF POLITICS. CONFRONTED WITH
SUCH A PHENOMENON, A MAN WHO IS ENDOWED WITH REAL QUALITIES OF
LEADERSHIP WILL BE TEMPTED TO REFRAIN FROM TAKING PART IN POLITICAL
LIFE; BECAUSE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE SITUATION DOES NOT CALL FOR
A MAN WHO HAS A CAPACITY FOR CONSTRUCTIVE STATESMANSHIP BUT RATHER FOR A
MAN WHO IS CAPABLE OF BARGAINING FOR THE FAVOUR OF THE MAJORITY. THUS
THE SITUATION WILL APPEAL TO SMALL MINDS AND WILL ATTRACT THEM
ACCORDINGLY.

THE NARROWER THE MENTAL OUTLOOK AND THE MORE MEAGRE THE AMOUNT OF
KNOWLEDGE IN A POLITICAL JOBBER, THE MORE ACCURATE IS HIS ESTIMATE OF
HIS OWN POLITICAL STOCK, AND THUS HE WILL BE ALL THE MORE INCLINED TO
APPRECIATE A SYSTEM WHICH DOES NOT DEMAND CREATIVE GENIUS OR EVEN
HIGH-CLASS TALENT; BUT RATHER THAT CRAFTY KIND OF SAGACITY WHICH MAKES
AN EFFICIENT TOWN CLERK. INDEED, HE VALUES THIS KIND OF SMALL CRAFTINESS
MORE THAN THE POLITICAL GENIUS OF A PERICLES. SUCH A MEDIOCRITY DOES NOT
EVEN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HE DOES. FROM THE
BEGINNING HE KNOWS THAT WHATEVER BE THE RESULTS OF HIS 'STATESMANSHIP'
HIS END IS ALREADY PRESCRIBED BY THE STARS; HE WILL ONE DAY HAVE TO
CLEAR OUT AND MAKE ROOM FOR ANOTHER WHO IS OF SIMILAR MENTAL CALIBRE.
FOR IT IS ANOTHER SIGN OF OUR DECADENT TIMES THAT THE NUMBER OF EMINENT
STATESMEN GROWS ACCORDING AS THE CALIBRE OF INDIVIDUAL PERSONALITY
DWINDLES. THAT CALIBRE WILL BECOME SMALLER AND SMALLER THE MORE THE
INDIVIDUAL POLITICIAN HAS TO DEPEND UPON PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITIES. A MAN
OF REAL POLITICAL ABILITY WILL REFUSE TO BE THE BEADLE FOR A BEVY OF
FOOTLING CACKLERS; AND THEY IN THEIR TURN, BEING THE REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE MAJORITY--WHICH MEANS THE DUNDER-HEADED MULTITUDE--HATE NOTHING SO
MUCH AS A SUPERIOR BRAIN.

FOR FOOTLING DEPUTIES IT IS ALWAYS QUITE A CONSOLATION TO BE LED BY A
PERSON WHOSE INTELLECTUAL STATURE IS ON A LEVEL WITH THEIR OWN. THUS
EACH ONE MAY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHINE IN DEBATE AMONG SUCH COMPEERS
AND, ABOVE ALL, EACH ONE FEELS THAT HE MAY ONE DAY RISE TO THE TOP. IF
PETER BE BOSS TO-DAY, THEN WHY NOT PAUL TOMORROW?

THIS NEW INVENTION OF DEMOCRACY IS VERY CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH A
PECULIAR PHENOMENON WHICH HAS RECENTLY SPREAD TO A PERNICIOUS EXTENT,
NAMELY THE COWARDICE OF A LARGE SECTION OF OUR SO-CALLED POLITICAL
LEADERS. WHENEVER IMPORTANT DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE THEY ALWAYS FIND
THEMSELVES FORTUNATE IN BEING ABLE TO HIDE BEHIND THE BACKS OF WHAT THEY
CALL THE MAJORITY.

IN OBSERVING ONE OF THESE POLITICAL MANIPULATORS ONE NOTICES HOW HE
WHEEDLES THE MAJORITY IN ORDER TO GET THEIR SANCTION FOR WHATEVER ACTION
HE TAKES. HE HAS TO HAVE ACCOMPLICES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SHIFT
RESPONSIBILITY TO OTHER SHOULDERS WHENEVER IT IS OPPORTUNE TO DO SO.
THAT IS THE MAIN REASON WHY THIS KIND OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY IS ABHORRENT
TO MEN OF CHARACTER AND COURAGE, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME IT ATTRACTS
INFERIOR TYPES; FOR A PERSON WHO IS NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY
FOR HIS OWN ACTIONS, BUT IS ALWAYS SEEKING TO BE COVERED BY SOMETHING,
MUST BE CLASSED AMONG THE KNAVES AND THE RASCALS. IF A NATIONAL LEADER
SHOULD COME FROM THAT LOWER CLASS OF POLITICIANS THE EVIL CONSEQUENCES
WILL SOON MANIFEST THEMSELVES. NOBODY WILL THEN HAVE THE COURAGE TO TAKE
A DECISIVE STEP. THEY WILL SUBMIT TO ABUSE AND DEFAMATION RATHER THAN
PLUCK UP COURAGE TO TAKE A DEFINITE STAND. AND THUS NOBODY IS LEFT WHO
IS WILLING TO RISK HIS POSITION AND HIS CAREER, IF NEEDS BE, IN SUPPORT
OF A DETERMINED LINE OF POLICY.

ONE TRUTH WHICH MUST ALWAYS BE BORNE IN MIND IS THAT THE MAJORITY CAN
NEVER REPLACE THE MAN. THE MAJORITY REPRESENTS NOT ONLY IGNORANCE BUT
ALSO COWARDICE. AND JUST AS A HUNDRED BLOCKHEADS DO NOT EQUAL ONE MAN OF
WISDOM, SO A HUNDRED POLTROONS ARE INCAPABLE OF ANY POLITICAL LINE OF
ACTION THAT REQUIRES MORAL STRENGTH AND FORTITUDE.

THE LIGHTER THE BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY ON EACH INDIVIDUAL LEADER, THE
GREATER WILL BE THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO, IN SPITE OF THEIR SORRY
MEDIOCRITY, WILL FEEL THE CALL TO PLACE THEIR IMMORTAL ENERGIES AT THE
DISPOSAL OF THE NATION. THEY ARE SO MUCH ON THE TIP-TOE OF EXPECTATION
THAT THEY FIND IT HARD TO WAIT THEIR TURN. THEY STAND IN A LONG QUEUE,
PAINFULLY AND SADLY COUNTING THE NUMBER OF THOSE AHEAD OF THEM AND
CALCULATING THE HOURS UNTIL THEY MAY EVENTUALLY COME FORWARD. THEY WATCH
EVERY CHANGE THAT TAKES PLACE IN THE PERSONNEL OF THE OFFICE TOWARDS
WHICH THEIR HOPES ARE DIRECTED, AND THEY ARE GRATEFUL FOR EVERY SCANDAL
WHICH REMOVES ONE OF THE ASPIRANTS WAITING AHEAD OF THEM IN THE QUEUE.
IF SOMEBODY STICKS TOO LONG TO HIS OFFICE STOOL THEY CONSIDER THIS AS
ALMOST A BREACH OF A SACRED UNDERSTANDING BASED ON THEIR MUTUAL
SOLIDARITY. THEY GROW FURIOUS AND GIVE NO PEACE UNTIL THAT INCONSIDERATE
PERSON IS FINALLY DRIVEN OUT AND FORCED TO HAND OVER HIS COSY BERTH FOR
PUBLIC DISPOSAL. AFTER THAT HE WILL HAVE LITTLE CHANCE OF GETTING
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY. USUALLY THOSE PLACEMEN WHO HAVE BEEN FORCED TO GIVE
UP THEIR POSTS PUSH THEMSELVES AGAIN INTO THE WAITING QUEUE UNLESS THEY
ARE HOUNDED AWAY BY THE PROTESTATIONS OF THE OTHER ASPIRANTS.

THE RESULT OF ALL THIS IS THAT, IN SUCH A STATE, THE SUCCESSION OF
SUDDEN CHANGES IN PUBLIC POSITIONS AND PUBLIC OFFICES HAS A VERY
DISQUIETING EFFECT IN GENERAL, WHICH MAY EASILY LEAD TO DISASTER WHEN AN
ADVERSE CRISIS ARISES. IT IS NOT ONLY THE IGNORANT AND THE INCOMPETENT
PERSON WHO MAY FALL VICTIM TO THOSE PARLIAMENTARY CONDITIONS, FOR THE
GENUINE LEADER MAY BE AFFECTED JUST AS MUCH AS THE OTHERS, IF NOT MORE
SO, WHENEVER FATE HAS CHANCED TO PLACE A CAPABLE MAN IN THE POSITION OF
LEADER. LET THE SUPERIOR QUALITY OF SUCH A LEADER BE ONCE RECOGNIZED AND
THE RESULT WILL BE THAT A JOINT FRONT WILL BE ORGANIZED AGAINST HIM,
PARTICULARLY IF THAT LEADER, THOUGH NOT COMING FROM THEIR RANKS, SHOULD
FALL INTO THE HABIT OF INTERMINGLING WITH THESE ILLUSTRIOUS NINCOMPOOPS
ON THEIR OWN LEVEL. THEY WANT TO HAVE ONLY THEIR OWN COMPANY AND WILL
QUICKLY TAKE A HOSTILE ATTITUDE TOWARDS ANY MAN WHO MIGHT SHOW HIMSELF
OBVIOUSLY ABOVE AND BEYOND THEM WHEN HE MINGLES IN THEIR RANKS. THEIR
INSTINCT, WHICH IS SO BLIND IN OTHER DIRECTIONS, IS VERY SHARP IN THIS
PARTICULAR.

THE INEVITABLE RESULT IS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL LEVEL OF THE RULING CLASS
SINKS STEADILY. ONE CAN EASILY FORECAST HOW MUCH THE NATION AND STATE
ARE BOUND TO SUFFER FROM SUCH A CONDITION OF AFFAIRS, PROVIDED ONE DOES
NOT BELONG TO THAT SAME CLASS OF 'LEADERS'.

THE PARLIAMENTARY RÃ©GIME IN THE OLD AUSTRIA WAS THE VERY ARCHETYPE OF
THE INSTITUTION AS I HAVE DESCRIBED IT.

THOUGH THE AUSTRIAN PRIME MINISTER WAS APPOINTED BY THE KING-EMPEROR,
THIS ACT OF APPOINTMENT MERELY GAVE PRACTICAL EFFECT TO THE WILL OF THE
PARLIAMENT. THE HUCKSTERING AND BARGAINING THAT WENT ON IN REGARD TO
EVERY MINISTERIAL POSITION SHOWED ALL THE TYPICAL MARKS OF WESTERN
DEMOCRACY. THE RESULTS THAT FOLLOWED WERE IN KEEPING WITH THE PRINCIPLES
APPLIED. THE INTERVALS BETWEEN THE REPLACEMENT OF ONE PERSON BY ANOTHER
GRADUALLY BECAME SHORTER, FINALLY ENDING UP IN A WILD RELAY CHASE. WITH
EACH CHANGE THE QUALITY OF THE 'STATESMAN' IN QUESTION DETERIORATED,
UNTIL FINALLY ONLY THE PETTY TYPE OF POLITICAL HUCKSTER REMAINED. IN
SUCH PEOPLE THE QUALITIES OF STATESMANSHIP WERE MEASURED AND VALUED
ACCORDING TO THE ADROITNESS WITH WHICH THEY PIECED TOGETHER ONE
COALITION AFTER ANOTHER; IN OTHER WORDS, THEIR CRAFTINESS IN
MANIPULATING THE PETTIEST POLITICAL TRANSACTIONS, WHICH IS THE ONLY KIND
OF PRACTICAL ACTIVITY SUITED TO THE APTITUDES OF THESE REPRESENTATIVES.

IN THIS SPHERE VIENNA WAS THE SCHOOL WHICH OFFERED THE MOST IMPRESSIVE
EXAMPLES.

ANOTHER FEATURE THAT ENGAGED MY ATTENTION QUITE AS MUCH AS THE FEATURES
I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OF WAS THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE TALENTS AND
KNOWLEDGE OF THESE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE ON THE ONE HAND AND, ON
THE OTHER, THE NATURE OF THE TASKS THEY HAD TO FACE. WILLINGLY OR
UNWILLINGLY, ONE COULD NOT HELP THINKING SERIOUSLY OF THE NARROW
INTELLECTUAL OUTLOOK OF THESE CHOSEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE VARIOUS
CONSTITUENT NATIONALITIES, AND ONE COULD NOT AVOID PONDERING ON THE
METHODS THROUGH WHICH THESE NOBLE FIGURES IN OUR PUBLIC LIFE WERE FIRST
DISCOVERED.

IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO MAKE A THOROUGH STUDY AND EXAMINATION OF THE WAY
IN WHICH THE REAL TALENTS OF THESE GENTLEMEN WERE DEVOTED TO THE SERVICE
OF THEIR COUNTRY; IN OTHER WORDS, TO ANALYSE THOROUGHLY THE TECHNICAL
PROCEDURE OF THEIR ACTIVITIES.

THE WHOLE SPECTACLE OF PARLIAMENTARY LIFE BECAME MORE AND MORE DESOLATE
THE MORE ONE PENETRATED INTO ITS INTIMATE STRUCTURE AND STUDIED THE
PERSONS AND PRINCIPLES OF THE SYSTEM IN A SPIRIT OF RUTHLESS
OBJECTIVITY. INDEED, IT IS VERY NECESSARY TO BE STRICTLY OBJECTIVE IN
THE STUDY OF THE INSTITUTION WHOSE SPONSORS TALK OF 'OBJECTIVITY' IN
EVERY OTHER SENTENCE AS THE ONLY FAIR BASIS OF EXAMINATION AND JUDGMENT.
IF ONE STUDIED THESE GENTLEMEN AND THE LAWS OF THEIR STRENUOUS EXISTENCE
THE RESULTS WERE SURPRISING.

THERE IS NO OTHER PRINCIPLE WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE QUITE SO ILL-CONCEIVED
AS THE PARLIAMENTARY PRINCIPLE, IF WE EXAMINE IT OBJECTIVELY.

IN OUR EXAMINATION OF IT WE MAY PASS OVER THE METHODS ACCORDING TO WHICH
THE ELECTION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES TAKES PLACE, AS WELL AS THE WAYS
WHICH BRING THEM INTO OFFICE AND BESTOW NEW TITLES ON THEM. IT IS QUITE
EVIDENT THAT ONLY TO A TINY DEGREE ARE PUBLIC WISHES OR PUBLIC
NECESSITIES SATISFIED BY THE MANNER IN WHICH AN ELECTION TAKES PLACE;
FOR EVERYBODY WHO PROPERLY ESTIMATES THE POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE OF THE
MASSES CAN EASILY SEE THAT THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY DEVELOPED TO ENABLE
THEM TO FORM GENERAL POLITICAL JUDGMENTS ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT, OR TO
SELECT THE MEN WHO MIGHT BE COMPETENT TO CARRY OUT THEIR IDEAS IN
PRACTICE.

WHATEVER DEFINITION WE MAY GIVE OF THE TERM 'PUBLIC OPINION', ONLY A
VERY SMALL PART OF IT ORIGINATES FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OR INDIVIDUAL
INSIGHT. THE GREATER PORTION OF IT RESULTS FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH
PUBLIC MATTERS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO THE PEOPLE THROUGH AN
OVERWHELMINGLY IMPRESSIVE AND PERSISTENT SYSTEM OF 'INFORMATION'.

IN THE RELIGIOUS SPHERE THE PROFESSION OF A DENOMINATIONAL BELIEF IS
LARGELY THE RESULT OF EDUCATION, WHILE THE RELIGIOUS YEARNING ITSELF
SLUMBERS IN THE SOUL; SO TOO THE POLITICAL OPINIONS OF THE MASSES ARE
THE FINAL RESULT OF INFLUENCES SYSTEMATICALLY OPERATING ON HUMAN
SENTIMENT AND INTELLIGENCE IN VIRTUE OF A METHOD WHICH IS APPLIED
SOMETIMES WITH ALMOST-INCREDIBLE THOROUGHNESS AND PERSEVERANCE.

BY FAR THE MOST EFFECTIVE BRANCH OF POLITICAL EDUCATION, WHICH IN THIS
CONNECTION IS BEST EXPRESSED BY THE WORD 'PROPAGANDA', IS CARRIED ON BY
THE PRESS. THE PRESS IS THE CHIEF MEANS EMPLOYED IN THE PROCESS OF
POLITICAL 'ENLIGHTENMENT'. IT REPRESENTS A KIND OF SCHOOL FOR ADULTS.
THIS EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY, HOWEVER, IS NOT IN THE HANDS OF THE STATE BUT
IN THE CLUTCHES OF POWERS WHICH ARE PARTLY OF A VERY INFERIOR CHARACTER.
WHILE STILL A YOUNG MAN IN VIENNA I HAD EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR
COMING TO KNOW THE MEN WHO OWNED THIS MACHINE FOR MASS INSTRUCTION, AS
WELL AS THOSE WHO SUPPLIED IT WITH THE IDEAS IT DISTRIBUTED. AT FIRST I
WAS QUITE SURPRISED WHEN I REALIZED HOW LITTLE TIME WAS NECESSARY FOR
THIS DANGEROUS GREAT POWER WITHIN THE STATE TO PRODUCE A CERTAIN BELIEF
AMONG THE PUBLIC; AND IN DOING SO THE GENUINE WILL AND CONVICTIONS OF
THE PUBLIC WERE OFTEN COMPLETELY MISCONSTRUED. IT TOOK THE PRESS ONLY A
FEW DAYS TO TRANSFORM SOME RIDICULOUSLY TRIVIAL MATTER INTO AN ISSUE OF
NATIONAL IMPORTANCE, WHILE VITAL PROBLEMS WERE COMPLETELY IGNORED OR
FILCHED AND HIDDEN AWAY FROM PUBLIC ATTENTION.

THE PRESS SUCCEEDED IN THE MAGICAL ART OF PRODUCING NAMES FROM NOWHERE
WITHIN THE COURSE OF A FEW WEEKS. THEY MADE IT APPEAR THAT THE GREAT
HOPES OF THE MASSES WERE BOUND UP WITH THOSE NAMES. AND SO THEY MADE
THOSE NAMES MORE POPULAR THAN ANY MAN OF REAL ABILITY COULD EVER HOPE TO
BE IN A LONG LIFETIME. ALL THIS WAS DONE, DESPITE THE FACT THAT SUCH
NAMES WERE UTTERLY UNKNOWN AND INDEED HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD OF EVEN UP TO
A MONTH BEFORE THE PRESS PUBLICLY EMBLAZONED THEM. AT THE SAME TIME OLD
AND TRIED FIGURES IN THE POLITICAL AND OTHER SPHERES OF LIFE QUICKLY
FADED FROM THE PUBLIC MEMORY AND WERE FORGOTTEN AS IF THEY WERE DEAD,
THOUGH STILL HEALTHY AND IN THE ENJOYMENT OF THEIR FULL VIGUOUR. OR
SOMETIMES SUCH MEN WERE SO VILELY ABUSED THAT IT LOOKED AS IF THEIR
NAMES WOULD SOON STAND AS PERMANENT SYMBOLS OF THE WORST KIND OF
BASENESS. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE PROPERLY THE REALLY PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE
WHICH THE PRESS CAN EXERCISE ONE HAD TO STUDY THIS INFAMOUS JEWISH
METHOD WHEREBY HONOURABLE AND DECENT PEOPLE WERE BESMIRCHED WITH MUD AND
FILTH, IN THE FORM OF LOW ABUSE AND SLANDER, FROM HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS
OF QUARTERS SIMULTANEOUSLY, AS IF COMMANDED BY SOME MAGIC FORMULA.

THESE HIGHWAY ROBBERS WOULD GRAB AT ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT SERVE THEIR
EVIL ENDS.

THEY WOULD POKE THEIR NOSES INTO THE MOST INTIMATE FAMILY AFFAIRS AND
WOULD NOT REST UNTIL THEY HAD SNIFFED OUT SOME PETTY ITEM WHICH COULD BE
USED TO DESTROY THE REPUTATION OF THEIR VICTIM. BUT IF THE RESULT OF ALL
THIS SNIFFING SHOULD BE THAT NOTHING DEROGATORY WAS DISCOVERED IN THE
PRIVATE OR PUBLIC LIFE OF THE VICTIM, THEY CONTINUED TO HURL ABUSE AT
HIM, IN THE BELIEF THAT SOME OF THEIR ANIMADVERSIONS WOULD STICK EVEN
THOUGH REFUTED A THOUSAND TIMES. IN MOST CASES IT FINALLY TURNED OUT
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE VICTIM TO CONTINUE HIS DEFENCE, BECAUSE THE ACCUSER
WORKED TOGETHER WITH SO MANY ACCOMPLICES THAT HIS SLANDERS WERE
RE-ECHOED INTERMINABLY. BUT THESE SLANDERERS WOULD NEVER OWN THAT THEY
WERE ACTING FROM MOTIVES WHICH INFLUENCE THE COMMON RUN OF HUMANITY OR
ARE UNDERSTOOD BY THEM. OH, NO. THE SCOUNDREL WHO DEFAMED HIS
CONTEMPORARIES IN THIS VILLAINOUS WAY WOULD CROWN HIMSELF WITH A HALO OF
HEROIC PROBITY FASHIONED OF UNCTUOUS PHRASEOLOGY AND TWADDLE ABOUT HIS
'DUTIES AS A JOURNALIST' AND OTHER MOULDY NONSENSE OF THAT KIND. WHEN
THESE CUTTLE-FISHES GATHERED TOGETHER IN LARGE SHOALS AT MEETINGS AND
CONGRESSES THEY WOULD GIVE OUT A LOT OF SLIMY TALK ABOUT A SPECIAL KIND
OF HONOUR WHICH THEY CALLED THE PROFESSIONAL HONOUR OF THE JOURNALIST.
THEN THE ASSEMBLED SPECIES WOULD BOW THEIR RESPECTS TO ONE ANOTHER.

THESE ARE THE KIND OF BEINGS THAT FABRICATE MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS OF WHAT
IS CALLED PUBLIC OPINION, FROM THE FOAM OF WHICH THE PARLIAMENTARY
APHRODITE EVENTUALLY ARISES.

SEVERAL VOLUMES WOULD BE NEEDED IF ONE WERE TO GIVE AN ADEQUATE ACCOUNT
OF THE WHOLE PROCEDURE AND FULLY DESCRIBE ALL ITS HOLLOW FALLACIES. BUT
IF WE PASS OVER THE DETAILS AND LOOK AT THE PRODUCT ITSELF WHILE IT IS
IN OPERATION I THINK THIS ALONE WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO OPEN THE EYES OF
EVEN THE MOST INNOCENT AND CREDULOUS PERSON, SO THAT HE MAY RECOGNIZE
THE ABSURDITY OF THIS INSTITUTION BY LOOKING AT IT OBJECTIVELY.

IN ORDER TO REALIZE HOW THIS HUMAN ABERRATION IS AS HARMFUL AS IT IS
ABSURD, THE TEST AND EASIEST METHOD IS TO COMPARE DEMOCRATIC
PARLIAMENTARIANISM WITH A GENUINE GERMAN DEMOCRACY.

THE REMARKABLE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PARLIAMENTARY FORM OF DEMOCRACY IS
THE FACT THAT A NUMBER OF PERSONS, LET US SAY FIVE HUNDRED--INCLUDING,
IN RECENT TIME, WOMEN ALSO--ARE ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT AND INVESTED WITH
AUTHORITY TO GIVE FINAL JUDGMENT ON ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. IN PRACTICE
THEY ALONE ARE THE GOVERNING BODY; FOR ALTHOUGH THEY MAY APPOINT A
CABINET, WHICH SEEMS OUTWARDLY TO DIRECT THE AFFAIRS OF STATE, THIS
CABINET HAS NOT A REAL EXISTENCE OF ITS OWN. IN REALITY THE SO-CALLED
GOVERNMENT CANNOT DO ANYTHING AGAINST THE WILL OF THE ASSEMBLY. IT CAN
NEVER BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT FOR ANYTHING, SINCE THE RIGHT OF DECISION IS
NOT VESTED IN THE CABINET BUT IN THE PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY. THE CABINET
ALWAYS FUNCTIONS ONLY AS THE EXECUTOR OF THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY. ITS
POLITICAL ABILITY CAN BE JUDGED ONLY ACCORDING TO HOW FAR IT SUCCEEDS IN
ADJUSTING ITSELF TO THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY OR IN PERSUADING THE
MAJORITY TO AGREE TO ITS PROPOSALS. BUT THIS MEANS THAT IT MUST DESCEND
FROM THE LEVEL OF A REAL GOVERNING POWER TO THAT OF A MENDICANT WHO HAS
TO BEG THE APPROVAL OF A MAJORITY THAT MAY BE GOT TOGETHER FOR THE TIME
BEING. INDEED, THE CHIEF PREOCCUPATION OF THE CABINET MUST BE TO SECURE
FOR ITSELF, IN THE CASE OF' EACH INDIVIDUAL MEASURE, THE FAVOUR OF THE
MAJORITY THEN IN POWER OR, FAILING THAT, TO FORM A NEW MAJORITY THAT
WILL BE MORE FAVOURABLY DISPOSED. IF IT SHOULD SUCCEED IN EITHER OF
THESE EFFORTS IT MAY GO ON 'GOVERNING' FOR A LITTLE WHILE. IF IT SHOULD
FAIL TO WIN OR FORM A MAJORITY IT MUST RETIRE. THE QUESTION WHETHER ITS
POLICY AS SUCH HAS BEEN RIGHT OR WRONG DOES NOT MATTER AT ALL.

THEREBY ALL RESPONSIBILITY IS ABOLISHED IN PRACTICE. TO WHAT
CONSEQUENCES SUCH A STATE OF AFFAIRS CAN LEAD MAY EASILY BE UNDERSTOOD
FROM THE FOLLOWING SIMPLE CONSIDERATIONS:

THOSE FIVE HUNDRED DEPUTIES WHO HAVE BEEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE COME
FROM VARIOUS DISSIMILAR CALLINGS IN LIFE AND SHOW VERY VARYING DEGREES
OF POLITICAL CAPACITY, WITH THE RESULT THAT THE WHOLE COMBINATION IS
DISJOINTED AND SOMETIMES PRESENTS QUITE A SORRY PICTURE. SURELY NOBODY
BELIEVES THAT THESE CHOSEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION ARE THE CHOICE
SPIRITS OR FIRST-CLASS INTELLECTS. NOBODY, I HOPE, IS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO
PRETEND THAT HUNDREDS OF STATESMEN CAN EMERGE FROM PAPERS PLACED IN THE
BALLOT BOX BY ELECTORS WHO ARE ANYTHING ELSE BUT AVERAGELY INTELLIGENT.
THE ABSURD NOTION THAT MEN OF GENIUS ARE BORN OUT OF UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE
CANNOT BE TOO STRONGLY REPUDIATED. IN THE FIRST PLACE, THOSE TIMES MAY
BE REALLY CALLED BLESSED WHEN ONE GENUINE STATESMAN MAKES HIS APPEARANCE
AMONG A PEOPLE. SUCH STATESMEN DO NOT APPEAR ALL AT ONCE IN HUNDREDS OR
MORE. SECONDLY, AMONG THE BROAD MASSES THERE IS INSTINCTIVELY A DEFINITE
ANTIPATHY TOWARDS EVERY OUTSTANDING GENIUS. THERE IS A BETTER CHANCE OF
SEEING A CAMEL PASS THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE THAN OF SEEING A REALLY
GREAT MAN 'DISCOVERED' THROUGH AN ELECTION.

WHATEVER HAS HAPPENED IN HISTORY ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE AVERAGE OF THE
BROAD PUBLIC HAS MOSTLY BEEN DUE TO THE DRIVING FORCE OF AN INDIVIDUAL
PERSONALITY.

BUT HERE FIVE HUNDRED PERSONS OF LESS THAN MODEST INTELLECTUAL QUALITIES
PASS JUDGMENT ON THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE NATION. THEY
FORM GOVERNMENTS WHICH IN TURN LEARN TO WIN THE APPROVAL OF THE
ILLUSTRIOUS ASSEMBLY FOR EVERY LEGISLATIVE STEP THAT MAY BE TAKEN, WHICH
MEANS THAT THE POLICY TO BE CARRIED OUT IS ACTUALLY THE POLICY OF THE
FIVE HUNDRED.

AND INDEED, GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE POLICY BEARS THE STAMP OF ITS
ORIGIN.

BUT LET US PASS OVER THE INTELLECTUAL QUALITIES OF THESE REPRESENTATIVES
AND ASK WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE TASK SET BEFORE THEM. IF WE CONSIDER
THE FACT THAT THE PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED AND SOLVED BELONG
TO THE MOST VARIED AND DIVERSE FIELDS WE CAN VERY WELL REALIZE HOW
INEFFICIENT A GOVERNING SYSTEM MUST BE WHICH ENTRUSTS THE RIGHT OF
DECISION TO A MASS ASSEMBLY IN WHICH ONLY VERY FEW POSSESS THE KNOWLEDGE
AND EXPERIENCE SUCH AS WOULD QUALIFY THEM TO DEAL WITH THE MATTERS THAT
HAVE TO BE SETTLED. THE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC MEASURES ARE SUBMITTED
TO A TRIBUNAL IN WHICH NOT MORE THAN ONE-TENTH OF THE MEMBERS HAVE
STUDIED THE ELEMENTS OF ECONOMICS. THIS MEANS THAT FINAL AUTHORITY IS
VESTED IN MEN WHO ARE UTTERLY DEVOID OF ANY PREPARATORY TRAINING WHICH
MIGHT MAKE THEM COMPETENT TO DECIDE ON THE QUESTIONS AT ISSUE.

THE SAME HOLDS TRUE OF EVERY OTHER PROBLEM. IT IS ALWAYS A MAJORITY OF
IGNORANT AND INCOMPETENT PEOPLE WHO DECIDE ON EACH MEASURE; FOR THE
COMPOSITION OF THE INSTITUTION DOES NOT VARY, WHILE THE PROBLEMS TO BE
DEALT WITH COME FROM THE MOST VARIED SPHERES OF PUBLIC LIFE. AN
INTELLIGENT JUDGMENT WOULD BE POSSIBLE ONLY IF DIFFERENT DEPUTIES HAD
THE AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH DIFFERENT ISSUES. IT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION
TO THINK THAT THE SAME PEOPLE ARE FITTED TO DECIDE ON TRANSPORT
QUESTIONS AS WELL AS, LET US SAY, ON QUESTIONS OF FOREIGN POLICY, UNLESS
EACH OF THEM BE A UNIVERSAL GENIUS. BUT SCARCELY MORE THAN ONE GENIUS
APPEARS IN A CENTURY. HERE WE ARE SCARCELY EVER DEALING WITH REAL
BRAINS, BUT ONLY WITH DILETTANTI WHO ARE AS NARROW-MINDED AS THEY ARE
CONCEITED AND ARROGANT, INTELLECTUAL DEMI-MONDES OF THE WORST KIND. THIS
IS WHY THESE HONOURABLE GENTLEMEN SHOW SUCH ASTONISHING LEVITY IN
DISCUSSING AND DECIDING ON MATTERS THAT WOULD DEMAND THE MOST
PAINSTAKING CONSIDERATION EVEN FROM GREAT MINDS. MEASURES OF MOMENTOUS
IMPORTANCE FOR THE FUTURE EXISTENCE OF THE STATE ARE FRAMED AND
DISCUSSED IN AN ATMOSPHERE MORE SUITED TO THE CARD-TABLE. INDEED THE
LATTER SUGGESTS A MUCH MORE FITTING OCCUPATION FOR THESE GENTLEMEN THAN
THAT OF DECIDING THE DESTINIES OF A PEOPLE.

OF COURSE IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO ASSUME THAT EACH MEMBER IN SUCH A
PARLIAMENT WAS ENDOWED BY NATURE WITH SUCH A SMALL SENSE OF
RESPONSIBILITY. THAT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION.

BUT THIS SYSTEM, BY FORCING THE INDIVIDUAL TO PASS JUDGMENT ON QUESTIONS
FOR WHICH HE IS NOT COMPETENT GRADUALLY DEBASES HIS MORAL CHARACTER.
NOBODY WILL HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY: "GENTLEMEN, I AM AFRAID WE KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. I FOR ONE HAVE NO COMPETENCY IN
THE MATTER AT ALL." ANYHOW IF SUCH A DECLARATION WERE MADE IT WOULD NOT
CHANGE MATTERS VERY MUCH; FOR SUCH OUTSPOKEN HONESTY WOULD NOT BE
UNDERSTOOD. THE PERSON WHO MADE THE DECLARATION WOULD BE DEEMED AN
HONOURABLE ASS WHO OUGHT NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO SPOIL THE GAME. THOSE WHO
HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE KNOW THAT NOBODY LIKES TO BE CONSIDERED
A FOOL AMONG HIS ASSOCIATES; AND IN CERTAIN CIRCLES HONESTY IS TAKEN AS
AN INDEX OF STUPIDITY.

THUS IT HAPPENS THAT A NATURALLY UPRIGHT MAN, ONCE HE FINDS HIMSELF
ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT, MAY EVENTUALLY BE INDUCED BY THE FORCE OF
CIRCUMSTANCES TO ACQUIESCE IN A GENERAL LINE OF CONDUCT WHICH IS BASE IN
ITSELF AND AMOUNTS TO A BETRAYAL OF THE PUBLIC TRUST. THAT FEELING THAT
IF THE INDIVIDUAL REFRAINED FROM TAKING PART IN A CERTAIN DECISION HIS
ATTITUDE WOULD NOT ALTER THE SITUATION IN THE LEAST, DESTROYS EVERY REAL
SENSE OF HONOUR WHICH MIGHT OCCASIONALLY AROUSE THE CONSCIENCE OF ONE
PERSON OR ANOTHER. FINALLY, THE OTHERWISE UPRIGHT DEPUTY WILL SUCCEED IN
PERSUADING HIMSELF THAT HE IS BY NO MEANS THE WORST OF THE LOT AND THAT
BY TAKING PART IN A CERTAIN LINE OF ACTION HE MAY PREVENT SOMETHING
WORSE FROM HAPPENING.

A COUNTER ARGUMENT MAY BE PUT FORWARD HERE. IT MAY BE SAID THAT OF
COURSE THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBER MAY NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS
REQUISITE FOR THE TREATMENT OF THIS OR THAT QUESTION, YET HIS ATTITUDE
TOWARDS IT IS TAKEN ON THE ADVICE OF HIS PARTY AS THE GUIDING AUTHORITY
IN EACH POLITICAL MATTER; AND IT MAY FURTHER BE SAID THAT THE PARTY SETS
UP SPECIAL COMMITTEES OF EXPERTS WHO HAVE EVEN MORE THAN THE REQUISITE
KNOWLEDGE FOR DEALING WITH THE QUESTIONS PLACED BEFORE THEM.

AT FIRST SIGHT, THAT ARGUMENT SEEMS SOUND. BUT THEN ANOTHER QUESTION
ARISES--NAMELY, WHY ARE FIVE HUNDRED PERSONS ELECTED IF ONLY A FEW HAVE
THE WISDOM WHICH IS REQUIRED TO DEAL WITH THE MORE IMPORTANT PROBLEMS?

IT IS NOT THE AIM OF OUR MODERN DEMOCRATIC PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM TO BRING
TOGETHER AN ASSEMBLY OF INTELLIGENT AND WELL-INFORMED DEPUTIES. NOT AT
ALL. THE AIM RATHER IS TO BRING TOGETHER A GROUP OF NONENTITIES WHO ARE
DEPENDENT ON OTHERS FOR THEIR VIEWS AND WHO CAN BE ALL THE MORE EASILY
LED, THE NARROWER THE MENTAL OUTLOOK OF EACH INDIVIDUAL IS. THAT IS THE
ONLY WAY IN WHICH A PARTY POLICY, ACCORDING TO THE EVIL MEANING IT HAS
TO-DAY, CAN BE PUT INTO EFFECT. AND BY THIS METHOD ALONE IT IS POSSIBLE
FOR THE WIREPULLER, WHO EXERCISES THE REAL CONTROL, TO REMAIN IN THE
DARK, SO THAT PERSONALLY HE CAN NEVER BE BROUGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS
ACTIONS. FOR UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES NONE OF THE DECISIONS TAKEN, NO
MATTER HOW DISASTROUS THEY MAY TURN OUT FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE, CAN
BE LAID AT THE DOOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHOM EVERYBODY KNOWS TO BE THE
EVIL GENIUS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WHOLE AFFAIR. ALL RESPONSIBILITY IS
SHIFTED TO THE SHOULDERS OF THE PARTY AS A WHOLE.

IN PRACTICE NO ACTUAL RESPONSIBILITY REMAINS. FOR RESPONSIBILITY ARISES
ONLY FROM PERSONAL DUTY AND NOT FROM THE OBLIGATIONS THAT REST WITH A
PARLIAMENTARY ASSEMBLY OF EMPTY TALKERS.

THE PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTION ATTRACTS PEOPLE OF THE BADGER TYPE, WHO DO
NOT LIKE THE OPEN LIGHT. NO UPRIGHT MAN, WHO IS READY TO ACCEPT PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS ACTS, WILL BE ATTRACTED TO SUCH AN INSTITUTION.

THAT IS THE REASON WHY THIS BRAND OF DEMOCRACY HAS BECOME A TOOL IN THE
HAND OF THAT RACE WHICH, BECAUSE OF THE INNER PURPOSES IT WISHES TO
ATTAIN, MUST SHUN THE OPEN LIGHT, AS IT HAS ALWAYS DONE AND ALWAYS WILL
DO. ONLY A JEW CAN PRAISE AN INSTITUTION WHICH IS AS CORRUPT AND FALSE
AS HIMSELF.

AS A CONTRAST TO THIS KIND OF DEMOCRACY WE HAVE THE GERMAN DEMOCRACY,
WHICH IS A TRUE DEMOCRACY; FOR HERE THE LEADER IS FREELY CHOSEN AND IS
OBLIGED TO ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL HIS ACTIONS AND OMISSIONS.
THE PROBLEMS TO BE DEALT WITH ARE NOT PUT TO THE VOTE OF THE MAJORITY;
BUT THEY ARE DECIDED UPON BY THE INDIVIDUAL, AND AS A GUARANTEE OF
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE DECISIONS HE PLEDGES ALL HE HAS IN THE WORLD
AND EVEN HIS LIFE.

THE OBJECTION MAY BE RAISED HERE THAT UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS IT WOULD BE
VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND A MAN WHO WOULD BE READY TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO SO
FATEFUL A TASK. THE ANSWER TO THAT OBJECTION IS AS FOLLOWS:

WE THANK GOD THAT THE INNER SPIRIT OF OUR GERMAN DEMOCRACY WILL OF
ITSELF PREVENT THE CHANCE CAREERIST, WHO MAY BE INTELLECTUALLY WORTHLESS
AND A MORAL TWISTER, FROM COMING BY DEVIOUS WAYS TO A POSITION IN WHICH
HE MAY GOVERN HIS FELLOW-CITIZENS. THE FEAR OF UNDERTAKING SUCH
FAR-REACHING RESPONSIBILITIES, UNDER GERMAN DEMOCRACY, WILL SCARE OFF
THE IGNORANT AND THE FECKLESS.

BUT SHOULD IT HAPPEN THAT SUCH A PERSON MIGHT CREEP IN SURREPTITIOUSLY
IT WILL BE EASY ENOUGH TO IDENTIFY HIM AND APOSTROPHIZE HIM RUTHLESSLY.
SOMEWHAT THUS: "BE OFF, YOU SCOUNDREL. DON'T SOIL THESE STEPS WITH YOUR
FEET; BECAUSE THESE ARE THE STEPS THAT LEAD TO THE PORTALS OF THE
PANTHEON OF HISTORY, AND THEY ARE NOT MEANT FOR PLACE-HUNTERS BUT FOR
MEN OF NOBLE CHARACTER."

SUCH WERE THE VIEWS I FORMED AFTER TWO YEARS OF ATTENDANCE AT THE
SESSIONS OF THE VIENNESE PARLIAMENT. THEN I WENT THERE NO MORE.

THE PARLIAMENTARY REGIME BECAME ONE OF THE CAUSES WHY THE STRENGTH OF
THE HABSBURG STATE STEADILY DECLINED DURING THE LAST YEARS OF ITS
EXISTENCE. THE MORE THE PREDOMINANCE OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT WAS WHITTLED
AWAY THROUGH PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE, THE MORE PROMINENT BECAME THE
SYSTEM OF PLAYING OFF ONE OF THE VARIOUS CONSTITUENT NATIONALITIES
AGAINST THE OTHER. IN THE IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT IT WAS ALWAYS THE GERMAN
ELEMENT THAT SUFFERED THROUGH THE SYSTEM, WHICH MEANT THAT THE RESULTS
WERE DETRIMENTAL TO THE EMPIRE AS A WHOLE; FOR AT THE CLOSE OF THE
CENTURY EVEN THE MOST SIMPLE-MINDED PEOPLE COULD RECOGNIZE THAT THE
COHESIVE FORCES WITHIN THE DUAL MONARCHY NO LONGER SUFFICED TO
COUNTERBALANCE THE SEPARATIST TENDENCIES OF THE PROVINCIAL
NATIONALITIES. ON THE CONTRARY!

THE MEASURES WHICH THE STATE ADOPTED FOR ITS OWN MAINTENANCE BECAME MORE
AND MORE MEAN SPIRITED AND IN A LIKE DEGREE THE GENERAL DISRESPECT FOR
THE STATE INCREASED. NOT ONLY HUNGARY BUT ALSO THE VARIOUS SLAV
PROVINCES GRADUALLY CEASED TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WITH THE MONARCHY
WHICH EMBRACED THEM ALL, AND ACCORDINGLY THEY DID NOT FEEL ITS WEAKNESS
AS IN ANY WAY DETRIMENTAL TO THEMSELVES. THEY RATHER WELCOMED THOSE
MANIFESTATIONS OF SENILE DECAY. THEY LOOKED FORWARD TO THE FINAL
DISSOLUTION OF THE STATE, AND NOT TO ITS RECOVERY.

THE COMPLETE COLLAPSE WAS STILL FORESTALLED IN PARLIAMENT BY THE
HUMILIATING CONCESSIONS THAT WERE MADE TO EVERY KIND OF IMPORTUNATE
DEMANDS, AT THE COST OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT. THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THE
DEFENCE OF THE STATE RESTED ON PLAYING OFF THE VARIOUS NATIONALITIES
AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. BUT THE GENERAL TREND OF THIS DEVELOPMENT WAS
DIRECTED AGAINST THE GERMANS. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE RIGHT OF SUCCESSION
TO THE THRONE CONFERRED CERTAIN INFLUENCE ON THE ARCHDUKE FRANZ
FERDINAND, THE POLICY OF INCREASING THE POWER OF THE CZECHS WAS CARRIED
OUT SYSTEMATICALLY FROM THE UPPER GRADES OF THE ADMINISTRATION DOWN TO
THE LOWER. WITH ALL THE MEANS AT HIS COMMAND THE HEIR TO THE DUAL
MONARCHY PERSONALLY FURTHERED THE POLICY THAT AIMED AT ELIMINATING THE
INFLUENCE OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT, OR AT LEAST HE ACTED AS PROTECTOR OF
THAT POLICY. BY THE USE OF STATE OFFICIALS AS TOOLS, PURELY GERMAN
DISTRICTS WERE GRADUALLY BUT DECISIVELY BROUGHT WITHIN THE DANGER ZONE
OF THE MIXED LANGUAGES. EVEN IN LOWER AUSTRIA THIS PROCESS BEGAN TO MAKE
HEADWAY WITH A CONSTANTLY INCREASING TEMPO AND VIENNA WAS LOOKED UPON BY
THE CZECHS AS THEIR BIGGEST CITY.

IN THE FAMILY CIRCLE OF THIS NEW HABSBURGER THE CZECH LANGUAGE WAS
FAVOURED. THE WIFE OF THE ARCHDUKE HAD FORMERLY BEEN A CZECH COUNTESS
AND WAS WEDDED TO THE PRINCE BY A MORGANATIC MARRIAGE. SHE CAME FROM AN
ENVIRONMENT WHERE HOSTILITY TO THE GERMANS HAD BEEN TRADITIONAL. THE
LEADING IDEA IN THE MIND OF THE ARCHDUKE WAS TO ESTABLISH A SLAV STATE
IN CENTRAL EUROPE, WHICH WAS TO BE CONSTRUCTED ON A PURELY CATHOLIC
BASIS, SO AS TO SERVE AS A BULWARK AGAINST ORTHODOX RUSSIA.

AS HAD HAPPENED OFTEN IN HABSBURG HISTORY, RELIGION WAS THUS EXPLOITED
TO SERVE A PURELY POLITICAL POLICY, AND IN THIS CASE A FATAL POLICY, AT
LEAST AS FAR AS GERMAN INTERESTS WERE CONCERNED. THE RESULT WAS
LAMENTABLE IN MANY RESPECTS.

NEITHER THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG NOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH RECEIVED THE
REWARD WHICH THEY EXPECTED. HABSBURG LOST THE THRONE AND THE CHURCH LOST
A GREAT STATE. BY EMPLOYING RELIGIOUS MOTIVES IN THE SERVICE OF
POLITICS, A SPIRIT WAS AROUSED WHICH THE INSTIGATORS OF THAT POLICY HAD
NEVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

FROM THE ATTEMPT TO EXTERMINATE GERMANISM IN THE OLD MONARCHY BY EVERY
AVAILABLE MEANS AROSE THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT IN AUSTRIA, AS A RESPONSE.

IN THE 'EIGHTIES OF THE LAST CENTURY MANCHESTER LIBERALISM, WHICH WAS
JEWISH IN ITS FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS, HAD REACHED THE ZENITH OF ITS INFLUENCE
IN THE DUAL MONARCHY, OR HAD ALREADY PASSED THAT POINT. THE REACTION
WHICH SET IN DID NOT ARISE FROM SOCIAL BUT FROM NATIONALISTIC
TENDENCIES, AS WAS ALWAYS THE CASE IN THE OLD AUSTRIA. THE INSTINCT OF
SELF-PRESERVATION DROVE THE GERMAN ELEMENT TO DEFEND ITSELF
ENERGETICALLY. ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS ONLY SLOWLY BEGAN TO GAIN AN
IMPORTANT INFLUENCE; BUT THEY WERE OF SECONDARY CONCERN. BUT OF THE
GENERAL POLITICAL CHAOS TWO PARTY ORGANIZATIONS EMERGED. THE ONE WAS
MORE OF A NATIONAL, AND THE OTHER MORE OF A SOCIAL, CHARACTER; BUT BOTH
WERE HIGHLY INTERESTING AND INSTRUCTIVE FOR THE FUTURE.

AFTER THE WAR OF 1866, WHICH HAD RESULTED IN THE HUMILIATION OF AUSTRIA,
THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG CONTEMPLATED A REVANCHE ON THE BATTLEFIELD. ONLY
THE TRAGIC END OF THE EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN OF MEXICO PREVENTED A STILL
CLOSER COLLABORATION WITH FRANCE. THE CHIEF BLAME FOR MAXIMILIAN'S
DISASTROUS EXPEDITION WAS ATTRIBUTED TO NAPOLEON III AND THE FACT THAT
THE FRENCHMAN LEFT HIM IN THE LURCH AROUSED A GENERAL FEELING OF
INDIGNATION. YET THE HABSBURGS WERE STILL LYING IN WAIT FOR THEIR
OPPORTUNITY. IF THE WAR OF 1870-71 HAD NOT BEEN SUCH A SINGULAR TRIUMPH,
THE VIENNESE COURT MIGHT HAVE CHANCED THE GAME OF BLOOD IN ORDER TO GET
ITS REVENGE FOR SADOWA. BUT WHEN THE FIRST REPORTS ARRIVED FROM THE
FRANCO-GERMAN BATTLEFIELD, WHICH, THOUGH TRUE, SEEMED MIRACULOUS AND
ALMOST INCREDIBLE, THE 'MOST WISE' OF ALL MONARCHS RECOGNIZED THAT THE
MOMENT WAS INOPPORTUNE AND TRIED TO ACCEPT THE UNFAVOURABLE SITUATION
WITH AS GOOD A GRACE AS POSSIBLE.

THE HEROIC CONFLICT OF THOSE TWO YEARS (1870-71) PRODUCED A STILL
GREATER MIRACLE; FOR WITH THE HABSBURGS THE CHANGE OF ATTITUDE NEVER
CAME FROM AN INNER HEARTFELT URGE BUT ONLY FROM THE PRESSURE OF
CIRCUMSTANCES. THE GERMAN PEOPLE OF THE EAST MARK, HOWEVER, WERE
ENTRANCED BY THE TRIUMPHANT GLORY OF THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED GERMAN EMPIRE
AND WERE PROFOUNDLY MOVED WHEN THEY SAW THE DREAM OF THEIR FATHERS
RESURGENT IN A MAGNIFICENT REALITY.

FOR--LET US MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT--THE TRUE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN REALIZED
FROM THIS TIME ONWARD, THAT KÃ¶NIGGRÃ¤TZ WAS THE TRAGIC, THOUGH NECESSARY,
PRE-CONDITION FOR THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EMPIRE WHICH SHOULD NO
LONGER BE BURDENED WITH THE PALSY OF THE OLD ALLIANCE AND WHICH INDEED
HAD NO SHARE IN THAT MORBID DECAY. ABOVE ALL, THE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN HAD
COME TO FEEL IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF HIS OWN BEING THAT THE HISTORICAL
MISSION OF THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG HAD COME TO AN END AND THAT THE NEW
EMPIRE COULD CHOOSE ONLY AN EMPEROR WHO WAS OF HEROIC MOULD AND WAS
THEREFORE WORTHY TO WEAR THE 'CROWN OF THE RHINE'. IT WAS RIGHT AND JUST
THAT DESTINY SHOULD BE PRAISED FOR HAVING CHOSEN A SCION OF THAT HOUSE
OF WHICH FREDERICK THE GREAT HAD IN PAST TIMES GIVEN THE NATION AN
ELEVATED AND RESPLENDENT SYMBOL FOR ALL TIME TO COME.

AFTER THE GREAT WAR OF 1870-71 THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG SET TO WORK WITH
ALL ITS DETERMINATION TO EXTERMINATE THE DANGEROUS GERMAN ELEMENT--ABOUT
WHOSE INNER FEELINGS AND ATTITUDE THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT--SLOWLY BUT
DELIBERATELY. I USE THE WORD EXTERMINATE, BECAUSE THAT ALONE EXPRESSES
WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE FINAL RESULT OF THE SLAVOPHILE POLICY. THEN IT
WAS THAT THE FIRE OF REBELLION BLAZED UP AMONG THE PEOPLE WHOSE
EXTERMINATION HAD BEEN DECREED. THAT FIRE WAS SUCH AS HAD NEVER BEEN
WITNESSED IN MODERN GERMAN HISTORY.

FOR THE FIRST TIME NATIONALISTS AND PATRIOTS WERE TRANSFORMED INTO
REBELS.

NOT REBELS AGAINST THE NATION OR THE STATE AS SUCH BUT REBELS AGAINST
THAT FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH THEY WERE CONVINCED, WOULD INEVITABLY
BRING ABOUT THE RUIN OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MODERN
HISTORY THE TRADITIONAL DYNASTIC PATRIOTISM AND NATIONAL LOVE OF
FATHERLAND AND PEOPLE WERE IN OPEN CONFLICT.

IT WAS TO THE MERIT OF THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT IN AUSTRIA DURING THE
CLOSING DECADE OF THE LAST CENTURY THAT IT POINTED OUT CLEARLY AND
UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT A STATE IS ENTITLED TO DEMAND RESPECT AND PROTECTION
FOR ITS AUTHORITY ONLY WHEN SUCH AUTHORITY IS ADMINISTERED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE INTERESTS OF THE NATION, OR AT LEAST NOT IN A MANNER
DETRIMENTAL TO THOSE INTERESTS.

THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE CAN NEVER BE AN END IN ITSELF; FOR, IF THAT
WERE SO, ANY KIND OF TYRANNY WOULD BE INVIOLABLE AND SACRED.

IF A GOVERNMENT USES THE INSTRUMENTS OF POWER IN ITS HANDS FOR THE
PURPOSE OF LEADING A PEOPLE TO RUIN, THEN REBELLION IS NOT ONLY THE
RIGHT BUT ALSO THE DUTY OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN.

THE QUESTION OF WHETHER AND WHEN SUCH A SITUATION EXISTS CANNOT BE
ANSWERED BY THEORETICAL DISSERTATIONS BUT ONLY BY THE EXERCISE OF FORCE,
AND IT IS SUCCESS THAT DECIDES THE ISSUE.

EVERY GOVERNMENT, EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE THE WORST POSSIBLE AND EVEN
THOUGH IT MAY HAVE BETRAYED THE NATION'S TRUST IN THOUSANDS OF WAYS,
WILL CLAIM THAT ITS DUTY IS TO UPHOLD THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE. ITS
ADVERSARIES, WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR NATIONAL SELF-PRESERVATION, MUST USE
THE SAME WEAPONS WHICH THE GOVERNMENT USES IF THEY ARE TO PREVAIL
AGAINST SUCH A RULE AND SECURE THEIR OWN FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE.
THEREFORE THE CONFLICT WILL BE FOUGHT OUT WITH 'LEGAL' MEANS AS LONG AS
THE POWER WHICH IS TO BE OVERTHROWN USES THEM; BUT THE INSURGENTS WILL
NOT HESITATE TO APPLY ILLEGAL MEANS IF THE OPPRESSOR HIMSELF EMPLOYS
THEM.

GENERALLY SPEAKING, WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT THE HIGHEST AIM OF HUMAN
EXISTENCE IS NOT THE MAINTENANCE OF A STATE OF GOVERNMENT BUT RATHER THE
CONSERVATION OF THE RACE.

IF THE RACE IS IN DANGER OF BEING OPPRESSED OR EVEN EXTERMINATED THE
QUESTION OF LEGALITY IS ONLY OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE. THE ESTABLISHED
POWER MAY IN SUCH A CASE EMPLOY ONLY THOSE MEANS WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED AS
'LEGAL'. YET THE INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION ON THE PART OF THE
OPPRESSED WILL ALWAYS JUSTIFY, TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE, THE EMPLOYMENT OF
ALL POSSIBLE RESOURCES.

ONLY ON THE RECOGNITION OF THIS PRINCIPLE WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR THOSE
STRUGGLES TO BE CARRIED THROUGH, OF WHICH HISTORY FURNISHES MAGNIFICENT
EXAMPLES IN ABUNDANCE, AGAINST FOREIGN BONDAGE OR OPPRESSION AT HOME.

HUMAN RIGHTS ARE ABOVE THE RIGHTS OF THE STATE. BUT IF A PEOPLE BE
DEFEATED IN THE STRUGGLE FOR ITS HUMAN RIGHTS THIS MEANS THAT ITS WEIGHT
HAS PROVED TOO LIGHT IN THE SCALE OF DESTINY TO HAVE THE LUCK OF BEING
ABLE TO ENDURE IN THIS TERRESTRIAL WORLD.

THE WORLD IS NOT THERE TO BE POSSESSED BY THE FAINT-HEARTED RACES.



AUSTRIA AFFORDS A VERY CLEAR AND STRIKING EXAMPLE OF HOW EASY IT IS FOR
TYRANNY TO HIDE ITS HEAD UNDER THE CLOAK OF WHAT IS CALLED 'LEGALITY'.

THE LEGAL EXERCISE OF POWER IN THE HABSBURG STATE WAS THEN BASED ON THE
ANTI-GERMAN ATTITUDE OF THE PARLIAMENT, WITH ITS NON-GERMAN MAJORITIES,
AND ON THE DYNASTIC HOUSE, WHICH WAS ALSO HOSTILE TO THE GERMAN ELEMENT.
THE WHOLE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE WAS INCORPORATED IN THESE TWO FACTORS.
TO ATTEMPT TO ALTER THE LOT OF THE GERMAN ELEMENT THROUGH THESE TWO
FACTORS WOULD HAVE BEEN SENSELESS. THOSE WHO ADVISED THE 'LEGAL' WAY AS
THE ONLY POSSIBLE WAY, AND ALSO OBEDIENCE TO THE STATE AUTHORITY, COULD
OFFER NO RESISTANCE; BECAUSE A POLICY OF RESISTANCE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN
PUT INTO EFFECT THROUGH LEGAL MEASURES. TO FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF THE
LEGALIST COUNSELLORS WOULD HAVE MEANT THE INEVITABLE RUIN OF THE GERMAN
ELEMENT WITHIN THE MONARCHY, AND THIS DISASTER WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN LONG
TO COME. THE GERMAN ELEMENT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN SAVED ONLY BECAUSE THE
STATE AS SUCH COLLAPSED.

THE SPECTACLED THEORIST WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS LIFE FOR HIS DOCTRINE
RATHER THAN FOR HIS PEOPLE.

BECAUSE MAN HAS MADE LAWS HE SUBSEQUENTLY COMES TO THINK THAT HE EXISTS
FOR THE SAKE OF THE LAWS.

A GREAT SERVICE RENDERED BY THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT THEN WAS THAT IT
ABOLISHED ALL SUCH NONSENSE, THOUGH THE DOCTRINAIRE THEORISTS AND OTHER
FETISH WORSHIPPERS WERE SHOCKED.

WHEN THE HABSBURGS ATTEMPTED TO COME TO CLOSE QUARTERS WITH THE GERMAN
ELEMENT, BY THE EMPLOYMENT OF ALL THE MEANS OF ATTACK WHICH THEY HAD AT
THEIR COMMAND, THE PAN-GERMAN PARTY HIT OUT RUTHLESSLY AGAINST THE
'ILLUSTRIOUS' DYNASTY. THIS PARTY WAS THE FIRST TO PROBE INTO AND EXPOSE
THE CORRUPT CONDITION OF THE STATE; AND IN DOING SO THEY OPENED THE EYES
OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. TO HAVE LIBERATED THE HIGH IDEAL OF LOVE FOR
ONE'S COUNTRY FROM THE EMBRACE OF THIS DEPLORABLE DYNASTY WAS ONE OF THE
GREAT SERVICES RENDERED BY THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT.

WHEN THAT PARTY FIRST MADE ITS APPEARANCE IT SECURED A LARGE
FOLLOWING--INDEED, THE MOVEMENT THREATENED TO BECOME ALMOST AN
AVALANCHE. BUT THE FIRST SUCCESSES WERE NOT MAINTAINED. AT THE TIME I
CAME TO VIENNA THE PAN-GERMAN PARTY HAD BEEN ECLIPSED BY THE
CHRISTIAN-SOCIALIST PARTY, WHICH HAD COME INTO POWER IN THE MEANTIME.
INDEED, THE PAN-GERMAN PARTY HAD SUNK TO A LEVEL OF ALMOST COMPLETE
INSIGNIFICANCE.

THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT ON THE ONE HAND AND THE
MARVELLOUS PROGRESS OF THE CHRISTIAN-SOCIALIST PARTY ON THE OTHER,
BECAME A CLASSIC OBJECT OF STUDY FOR ME, AND AS SUCH THEY PLAYED AN
IMPORTANT PART IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MY OWN VIEWS.

WHEN I CAME TO VIENNA ALL MY SYMPATHIES WERE EXCLUSIVELY WITH THE
PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT.

I WAS JUST AS MUCH IMPRESSED BY THE FACT THAT THEY HAD THE COURAGE TO
SHOUT HEIL HOHENZOLLERN AS I REJOICED AT THEIR DETERMINATION TO CONSIDER
THEMSELVES AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE, FROM WHICH THEY WERE
SEPARATED ONLY PROVISIONALLY. THEY NEVER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPLAIN THEIR ATTITUDE IN PUBLIC, WHICH RAISED MY ENTHUSIASM AND
CONFIDENCE. TO AVOW ONE'S PRINCIPLES PUBLICLY ON EVERY PROBLEM THAT
CONCERNED GERMANISM, AND NEVER TO MAKE ANY COMPROMISES, SEEMED TO ME THE
ONLY WAY OF SAVING OUR PEOPLE. WHAT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WAS HOW THIS
MOVEMENT BROKE DOWN SO SOON AFTER SUCH A MAGNIFICENT START; AND IT WAS
NO LESS INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT THE CHRISTIAN-SOCIALISTS SHOULD GAIN SUCH
TREMENDOUS POWER WITHIN SUCH A SHORT TIME. THEY HAD JUST REACHED THE
PINNACLE OF THEIR POPULARITY.

WHEN I BEGAN TO COMPARE THOSE TWO MOVEMENTS FATE PLACED BEFORE ME THE
BEST MEANS OF UNDERSTANDING THE CAUSES OF THIS PUZZLING PROBLEM. THE
ACTION OF FATE IN THIS CASE WAS HASTENED BY MY OWN STRAITENED
CIRCUMSTANCES.

I SHALL BEGIN MY ANALYSIS WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE TWO MEN WHO MUST BE
REGARDED AS THE FOUNDERS AND LEADERS OF THE TWO MOVEMENTS. THESE WERE
GEORGE VON SCHÃ¶NERER AND DR. KARL LUEGER.

AS FAR AS PERSONALITY GOES, BOTH WERE FAR ABOVE THE LEVEL AND STATURE OF
THE SO-CALLED PARLIAMENTARY FIGURES. THEY LIVED LIVES OF IMMACULATE AND
IRREPROACHABLE PROBITY AMIDST THE MIASMA OF ALL-ROUND POLITICAL
CORRUPTION. PERSONALLY I FIRST LIKED THE PAN-GERMAN REPRESENTATIVE,
SCHÃ¶NERER, AND IT WAS ONLY AFTERWARDS AND GRADUALLY THAT I FELT AN EQUAL
LIKING FOR THE CHRISTIAN-SOCIALIST LEADER.

WHEN I COMPARED THEIR RESPECTIVE ABILITIES SCHÃ¶NERER SEEMED TO ME A
BETTER AND MORE PROFOUND THINKER ON FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS. HE FORESAW THE
INEVITABLE DOWNFALL OF THE AUSTRIAN STATE MORE CLEARLY AND ACCURATELY
THAN ANYONE ELSE. IF THIS WARNING IN REGARD TO THE HABSBURG EMPIRE HAD
BEEN HEEDED IN GERMANY THE DISASTROUS WORLD WAR, WHICH INVOLVED GERMANY
AGAINST THE WHOLE OF EUROPE, WOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

BUT THOUGH SCHÃ¶NERER SUCCEEDED IN PENETRATING TO THE ESSENTIALS OF A
PROBLEM HE WAS VERY OFTEN MUCH MISTAKEN IN HIS JUDGMENT OF MEN.

AND HEREIN LAY DR. LUEGER'S SPECIAL TALENT. HE HAD A RARE GIFT OF
INSIGHT INTO HUMAN NATURE AND HE WAS VERY CAREFUL NOT TO TAKE MEN AS
SOMETHING BETTER THAN THEY WERE IN REALITY. HE BASED HIS PLANS ON THE
PRACTICAL POSSIBILITIES WHICH HUMAN LIFE OFFERED HIM, WHEREAS SCHÃ¶NERER
HAD ONLY LITTLE DISCRIMINATION IN THAT RESPECT. ALL IDEAS THAT THIS
PAN-GERMAN HAD WERE RIGHT IN THE ABSTRACT, BUT HE DID NOT HAVE THE
FORCEFULNESS OR UNDERSTANDING NECESSARY TO PUT HIS IDEAS ACROSS TO THE
BROAD MASSES. HE WAS NOT ABLE TO FORMULATE THEM SO THAT THEY COULD BE
EASILY GRASPED BY THE MASSES, WHOSE POWERS OF COMPREHENSION ARE LIMITED
AND WILL ALWAYS REMAIN SO. THEREFORE ALL SCHÃ¶NERER'S KNOWLEDGE WAS ONLY
THE WISDOM OF A PROPHET AND HE NEVER COULD SUCCEED IN HAVING IT PUT INTO
PRACTICE.

THIS LACK OF INSIGHT INTO HUMAN NATURE LED HIM TO FORM A WRONG ESTIMATE
OF THE FORCES BEHIND CERTAIN MOVEMENTS AND THE INHERENT STRENGTH OF OLD
INSTITUTIONS.

SCHÃ¶NERER INDEED REALIZED THAT THE PROBLEMS HE HAD TO DEAL WITH WERE IN
THE NATURE OF A WELTANSCHAUUNG; BUT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT ONLY THE
BROAD MASSES OF A NATION CAN MAKE SUCH CONVICTIONS PREVAIL, WHICH ARE
ALMOST OF A RELIGIOUS NATURE.

UNFORTUNATELY HE UNDERSTOOD ONLY VERY IMPERFECTLY HOW FEEBLE IS THE
FIGHTING SPIRIT OF THE SO-CALLED BOURGEOISIE. THAT WEAKNESS IS DUE TO
THEIR BUSINESS INTERESTS, WHICH INDIVIDUALS ARE TOO MUCH AFRAID OF
RISKING AND WHICH THEREFORE DETER THEM FROM TAKING ACTION. AND,
GENERALLY SPEAKING, A WELTANSCHAUUNG CAN HAVE NO PROSPECT OF SUCCESS
UNLESS THE BROAD MASSES DECLARE THEMSELVES READY TO ACT AS ITS
STANDARD-BEARERS AND TO FIGHT ON ITS BEHALF WHEREVER AND TO WHATEVER
EXTENT THAT MAY BE NECESSARY.

THIS FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LOWER STRATA OF THE
POPULATION RESULTED IN A VERY INADEQUATE CONCEPT OF THE SOCIAL PROBLEM.

IN ALL THIS DR. LUEGER WAS THE OPPOSITE OF SCHÃ¶NERER. HIS PROFOUND
KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE ENABLED HIM TO FORM A CORRECT ESTIMATE OF THE
VARIOUS SOCIAL FORCES AND IT SAVED HIM FROM UNDER-RATING THE POWER OF
EXISTING INSTITUTIONS. AND IT WAS PERHAPS THIS VERY QUALITY WHICH
ENABLED HIM TO UTILIZE THOSE INSTITUTIONS AS A MEANS TO SERVE THE
PURPOSES OF HIS POLICY.

HE SAW ONLY TOO CLEARLY THAT, IN OUR EPOCH, THE POLITICAL FIGHTING POWER
OF THE UPPER CLASSES IS QUITE INSIGNIFICANT AND NOT AT ALL CAPABLE OF
FIGHTING FOR A GREAT NEW MOVEMENT UNTIL THE TRIUMPH OF THAT MOVEMENT BE
SECURED. THUS HE DEVOTED THE GREATEST PART OF HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY TO
THE TASK OF WINNING OVER THOSE SECTIONS OF THE POPULATION WHOSE
EXISTENCE WAS IN DANGER AND FOSTERING THE MILITANT SPIRIT IN THEM RATHER
THAN ATTEMPTING TO PARALYSE IT. HE WAS ALSO QUICK TO ADOPT ALL AVAILABLE
MEANS FOR WINNING THE SUPPORT OF LONG-ESTABLISHED INSTITUTIONS, SO AS TO
BE ABLE TO DERIVE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE FOR HIS MOVEMENT FROM
THOSE OLD SOURCES OF POWER.

THUS IT WAS THAT, FIRST OF ALL, HE CHOSE AS THE SOCIAL BASIS OF HIS NEW
PARTY THAT MIDDLE CLASS WHICH WAS THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION. IN THIS
WAY HE SECURED A SOLID FOLLOWING WHICH WAS WILLING TO MAKE GREAT
SACRIFICES AND HAD GOOD FIGHTING STAMINA. HIS EXTREMELY WISE ATTITUDE
TOWARDS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH RAPIDLY WON OVER THE YOUNGER CLERGY IN SUCH
LARGE NUMBERS THAT THE OLD CLERICAL PARTY WAS FORCED TO RETIRE FROM THE
FIELD OF ACTION OR ELSE, WHICH WAS THE WISER COURSE, JOIN THE NEW PARTY,
IN THE HOPE OF GRADUALLY WINNING BACK ONE POSITION AFTER ANOTHER.

BUT IT WOULD BE A SERIOUS INJUSTICE TO THE MAN IF WE WERE TO REGARD THIS
AS HIS ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTIC. FOR HE POSSESSED THE QUALITIES OF AN
ABLE TACTICIAN, AND HAD THE TRUE GENIUS OF A GREAT REFORMER; BUT ALL
THESE WERE LIMITED BY HIS EXACT PERCEPTION OF THE POSSIBILITIES AT HAND
AND ALSO OF HIS OWN CAPABILITIES.

THE AIMS WHICH THIS REALLY EMINENT MAN DECIDED TO PURSUE WERE INTENSELY
PRACTICAL. HE WISHED TO CONQUER VIENNA, THE HEART OF THE MONARCHY. IT
WAS FROM VIENNA THAT THE LAST PULSES OF LIFE BEAT THROUGH THE DISEASED
AND WORN-OUT BODY OF THE DECREPIT EMPIRE. IF THE HEART COULD BE MADE
HEALTHIER THE OTHERS PARTS OF THE BODY WERE BOUND TO REVIVE. THAT IDEA
WAS CORRECT IN PRINCIPLE; BUT THE TIME WITHIN WHICH IT COULD BE APPLIED
IN PRACTICE WAS STRICTLY LIMITED. AND THAT WAS THE MAN'S WEAK POINT.

HIS ACHIEVEMENTS AS BURGOMASTER OF THE CITY OF VIENNA ARE IMMORTAL, IN
THE BEST SENSE OF THE WORD. BUT ALL THAT COULD NOT SAVE THE MONARCHY. IT
CAME TOO LATE.

HIS RIVAL, SCHÃ¶NERER, SAW THIS MORE CLEARLY. WHAT DR. LUEGER UNDERTOOK
TO PUT INTO PRACTICE TURNED OUT MARVELLOUSLY SUCCESSFUL. BUT THE RESULTS
WHICH HE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW THESE ACHIEVEMENTS DID NOT COME. SCHÃ¶NERER
DID NOT ATTAIN THE ENDS HE HAD PROPOSED TO HIMSELF; BUT HIS FEARS WERE
REALIZED, ALAS, IN A TERRIBLE FASHION. THUS BOTH THESE MEN FAILED TO
ATTAIN THEIR FURTHER OBJECTIVES. LUEGER COULD NOT SAVE AUSTRIA AND
SCHÃ¶NERER COULD NOT PREVENT THE DOWNFALL OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE IN
AUSTRIA.

TO STUDY THE CAUSES OF FAILURE IN THE CASE OF THESE TWO PARTIES IS TO
LEARN A LESSON THAT IS HIGHLY INSTRUCTIVE FOR OUR OWN EPOCH. THIS IS
SPECIALLY USEFUL FOR MY FRIENDS, BECAUSE IN MANY POINTS THE
CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR OWN DAY ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THAT TIME.
THEREFORE SUCH A LESSON MAY HELP US TO GUARD AGAINST THE MISTAKES WHICH
BROUGHT ONE OF THOSE MOVEMENTS TO AN END AND RENDERED THE OTHER BARREN
OF RESULTS.

IN MY OPINION, THE WRECK OF THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT IN AUSTRIA MUST BE
ATTRIBUTED TO THREE CAUSES.

THE FIRST OF THESE CONSISTED IN THE FACT THAT THE LEADERS DID NOT HAVE A
CLEAR CONCEPT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SOCIAL PROBLEM, PARTICULARLY FOR
A NEW MOVEMENT WHICH HAD AN ESSENTIALLY REVOLUTIONARY CHARACTER.
SCHÃ¶NERER AND HIS FOLLOWERS DIRECTED THEIR ATTENTION PRINCIPALLY TO THE
BOURGEOIS CLASSES. FOR THAT REASON THEIR MOVEMENT WAS BOUND TO TURN OUT
MEDIOCRE AND TAME. THE GERMAN BOURGEOISIE, ESPECIALLY IN ITS UPPER
CIRCLES, IS PACIFIST EVEN TO THE POINT OF COMPLETE
SELF-ABNEGATION--THOUGH THE INDIVIDUAL MAY NOT BE AWARE OF
THIS--WHEREVER THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THE NATION OR STATE ARE
CONCERNED. IN GOOD TIMES, WHICH IN THIS CASE MEANS TIMES OF GOOD
GOVERNMENT, SUCH A PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTITUDE MAKES THIS SOCIAL LAYER
EXTRAORDINARILY VALUABLE TO THE STATE. BUT WHEN THERE IS A BAD
GOVERNMENT, SUCH A QUALITY HAS A DESTRUCTIVE EFFECT. IN ORDER TO ASSURE
THE POSSIBILITY OF CARRYING THROUGH A REALLY STRENUOUS STRUGGLE, THE
PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT SHOULD HAVE DEVOTED ITS EFFORTS TO WINNING OVER THE
MASSES. THE FAILURE TO DO THIS LEFT THE MOVEMENT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
WITHOUT THE ELEMENTARY IMPULSE WHICH SUCH A WAVE NEEDS IF IT IS NOT TO
EBB WITHIN A SHORT WHILE.

IN FAILING TO SEE THE TRUTH OF THIS PRINCIPLE CLEARLY AT THE VERY OUTSET
OF THE MOVEMENT AND IN NEGLECTING TO PUT IT INTO PRACTICE THE NEW PARTY
MADE AN INITIAL MISTAKE WHICH COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE RECTIFIED
AFTERWARDS. FOR THE NUMEROUS MODERATE BOURGEOIS ELEMENTS ADMITTED INTO
THE MOVEMENTS INCREASINGLY DETERMINED ITS INTERNAL ORIENTATION AND THUS
FORESTALLED ALL FURTHER PROSPECTS OF GAINING ANY APPRECIABLE SUPPORT
AMONG THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE. UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS SUCH A MOVEMENT
COULD NOT GET BEYOND MERE DISCUSSION AND CRITICISM. QUASI-RELIGIOUS
FAITH AND THE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE WERE NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE MOVEMENT
ANY MORE. THEIR PLACE WAS TAKEN BY THE EFFORT TOWARDS 'POSITIVE'
COLLABORATION, WHICH IN THIS CASE MEANT THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE
EXISTING STATE OF AFFAIRS, GRADUALLY WHITTLING AWAY THE ROUGH CORNERS OF
THE QUESTIONS IN DISPUTE, AND ENDING UP WITH THE MAKING OF A
DISHONOURABLE PEACE.

SUCH WAS THE FATE OF THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT, BECAUSE AT THE START THE
LEADERS DID NOT REALIZE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT CONDITION OF SUCCESS WAS
THAT THEY SHOULD RECRUIT THEIR FOLLOWING FROM THE BROAD MASSES OF THE
PEOPLE. THE MOVEMENT THUS BECAME BOURGEOIS AND RESPECTABLE AND RADICAL
ONLY IN MODERATION.

FROM THIS FAILURE RESULTED THE SECOND CAUSE OF ITS RAPID DECLINE.

THE POSITION OF THE GERMANS IN AUSTRIA WAS ALREADY DESPERATE WHEN
PAN-GERMANISM AROSE. YEAR AFTER YEAR PARLIAMENT WAS BEING USED MORE AND
MORE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE GRADUAL EXTINCTION OF THE GERMAN-AUSTRIAN
POPULATION. THE ONLY HOPE FOR ANY ELEVENTH-HOUR EFFORT TO SAVE IT LAY IN
THE OVERTHROW OF THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM; BUT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE
PROSPECT OF THIS HAPPENING.

THEREWITH THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT WAS CONFRONTED WITH A QUESTION OF
PRIMARY IMPORTANCE.

TO OVERTHROW THE PARLIAMENT, SHOULD THE PAN-GERMANISTS HAVE ENTERED IT
'TO UNDERMINE IT FROM WITHIN', AS THE CURRENT PHRASE WAS? OR SHOULD THEY
HAVE ASSAILED THE INSTITUTION AS SUCH FROM THE OUTSIDE?

THEY ENTERED THE PARLIAMENT AND CAME OUT DEFEATED. BUT THEY HAD FOUND
THEMSELVES OBLIGED TO ENTER.

FOR IN ORDER TO WAGE AN EFFECTIVE WAR AGAINST SUCH A POWER FROM THE
OUTSIDE, INDOMITABLE COURAGE AND A READY SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE WERE
NECESSARY WEAPONS. IN SUCH CASES THE BULL MUST BE SEIZED BY THE HORNS.
FURIOUS DRIVES MAY BRING THE ASSAILANT TO THE GROUND AGAIN AND AGAIN;
BUT IF HE HAS A STOUT HEART HE WILL STAND UP, EVEN THOUGH SOME BONES MAY
BE BROKEN, AND ONLY AFTER A LONG AND TOUGH STRUGGLE WILL HE ACHIEVE HIS
TRIUMPH. NEW CHAMPIONS ARE ATTRACTED TO A CAUSE BY THE APPEAL OF GREAT
SACRIFICES MADE FOR ITS SAKE, UNTIL THAT INDOMITABLE SPIRIT IS FINALLY
CROWNED WITH SUCCESS.

FOR SUCH A RESULT, HOWEVER, THE CHILDREN OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE GREAT
MASSES ARE NECESSARY. THEY ALONE HAVE THE REQUISITE DETERMINATION AND
TENACITY TO FIGHT A SANGUINARY ISSUE THROUGH TO THE END. BUT THE
PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT DID NOT HAVE THESE BROAD MASSES AS ITS CHAMPIONS,
AND SO NO OTHER MEANS OF SOLUTION COULD BE TRIED OUT EXCEPT THAT OF
ENTERING PARLIAMCNT.

IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO THINK THAT THIS DECISION RESULTED FROM A LONG
SERIES OF INTERNAL HESITATIONS OF A MORAL KIND, OR THAT IT WAS THE
OUTCOME OF CAREFUL CALCULATION. NO. THEY DID NOT EVEN THINK OF ANOTHER
SOLUTION. THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THIS BLUNDER WERE ACTUATED BY
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS AND VAGUE NOTIONS AS TO WHAT WOULD BE THE
SIGNIFICANCE AND EFFECT OF TAKING PART IN SUCH A SPECIAL WAY IN THAT
INSTITUTION WHICH THEY HAD CONDEMNED ON PRINCIPLE. IN GENERAL THEY HOPED
THAT THEY WOULD THUS HAVE THE MEANS OF EXPOUNDING THEIR CAUSE TO THE
GREAT MASSES OF THE PEOPLE, BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEAK BEFORE
'THE FORUM OF THE WHOLE NATION'. ALSO, IT SEEMED REASONABLE TO BELIEVE
THAT BY ATTACKING THE EVIL IN THE ROOT THEY WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN
IF THE ATTACK CAME FROM OUTSIDE. THEY BELIEVED THAT, IF PROTECTED BY THE
IMMUNITY OF PARLIAMENT, THE POSITION OF THE INDIVIDUAL PROTAGONISTS
WOULD BE STRENGTHENED AND THAT THUS THE FORCE OF THEIR ATTACKS WOULD BE
ENHANCED.

IN REALITY EVERYTHING TURNED OUT QUITE OTHERWISE.

THE FORUM BEFORE WHICH THE PAN-GERMAN REPRESENTATIVES SPOKE HAD NOT
GROWN GREATER, BUT HAD ACTUALLY BECOME SMALLER; FOR EACH SPOKE ONLY TO
THE CIRCLE THAT WAS READY TO LISTEN TO HIM OR COULD READ THE REPORT OF
HIS SPEECH IN THE NEWSPAPERS.

BUT THE GREATER FORUM OF IMMEDIATE LISTENERS IS NOT THE PARLIAMENTARY
AUDITORIUM: IT IS THE LARGE PUBLIC MEETING. FOR HERE ALONE WILL THERE BE
THOUSANDS OF MEN WHO HAVE COME SIMPLY TO HEAR WHAT A SPEAKER HAS TO SAY,
WHEREAS IN THE PARLIAMENTARY SITTINGS ONLY A FEW HUNDRED ARE PRESENT;
AND FOR THE MOST PART THESE ARE THERE ONLY TO EARN THEIR DAILY ALLOWANCE
FOR ATTENDANCE AND NOT TO BE ENLIGHTENED BY THE WISDOM OF ONE OR OTHER
OF THE 'REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE'.

THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IS THAT THE SAME PUBLIC IS ALWAYS
PRESENT AND THAT THIS PUBLIC DOES NOT WISH TO LEARN ANYTHING NEW;
BECAUSE, SETTING ASIDE THE QUESTION OF ITS INTELLIGENCE, IT LACKS EVEN
THAT MODEST QUANTUM OF WILL-POWER WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE EFFORT OF
LEARNING.

NOT ONE OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE WILL PAY HOMAGE TO A
SUPERIOR TRUTH AND DEVOTE HIMSELF TO ITS SERVICE. NO. NOT ONE OF THESE
GENTRY WILL ACT THUS, EXCEPT HE HAS GROUNDS FOR HOPING THAT BY SUCH A
CONVERSION HE MAY BE ABLE TO RETAIN THE REPRESENTATION OF HIS
CONSTITUENCY IN THE COMING LEGISLATURE. THEREFORE, ONLY WHEN IT BECOMES
QUITE CLEAR THAT THE OLD PARTY IS LIKELY TO HAVE A BAD TIME OF IT AT THE
FORTHCOMING ELECTIONS--ONLY THEN WILL THOSE MODELS OF MANLY VIRTUE SET
OUT IN SEARCH OF A NEW PARTY OR A NEW POLICY WHICH MAY HAVE BETTER
ELECTORAL PROSPECTS; BUT OF COURSE THIS CHANGE OF POSITION WILL BE
ACCOMPANIED BY A VERITABLE DELUGE OF HIGH MORAL MOTIVES TO JUSTIFY IT.
AND THUS IT ALWAYS HAPPENS THAT WHEN AN EXISTING PARTY HAS INCURRED SUCH
GENERAL DISFAVOUR AMONG THE PUBLIC THAT IT IS THREATENED WITH THE
PROBABILITY OF A CRUSHING DEFEAT, THEN A GREAT MIGRATION COMMENCES. THE
PARLIAMENTARY RATS LEAVE THE PARTY SHIP.

ALL THIS HAPPENS NOT BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE CASE HAVE BECOME
BETTER INFORMED ON THE QUESTIONS AT ISSUE AND HAVE RESOLVED TO ACT
ACCORDINGLY. THESE CHANGES OF FRONT ARE EVIDENCE ONLY OF THAT GIFT OF
CLAIRVOYANCE WHICH WARNS THE PARLIAMENTARY FLEA AT THE RIGHT MOMENT AND
ENABLES HIM TO HOP INTO ANOTHER WARM PARTY BED.

TO SPEAK BEFORE SUCH A FORUM SIGNIFIES CASTING PEARLS BEFORE CERTAIN
ANIMALS.

VERILY IT DOES NOT REPAY THE PAINS TAKEN; FOR THE RESULT MUST ALWAYS BE
NEGATIVE.

AND THAT IS ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED. THE PAN-GERMAN REPRESENTATIVES MIGHT
HAVE TALKED THEMSELVES HOARSE, BUT TO NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER.

THE PRESS EITHER IGNORED THEM TOTALLY OR SO MUTILATED THEIR SPEECHES
THAT THE LOGICAL CONSISTENCY WAS DESTROYED OR THE MEANING TWISTED ROUND
IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE PUBLIC GOT ONLY A VERY WRONG IMPRESSION REGARDING
THE AIMS OF THE NEW MOVEMENT. WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS SAID WAS NOT
OF IMPORTANCE. THE IMPORTANT MATTER WAS WHAT PEOPLE READ AS COMING FROM
THEM. THIS CONSISTED OF MERE EXTRACTS WHICH HAD BEEN TORN OUT OF THE
CONTEXT OF THE SPEECHES AND GAVE AN IMPRESSION OF INCOHERENT NONSENSE,
WHICH INDEED WAS PURPOSELY MEANT. THUS THE ONLY PUBLIC BEFORE WHICH THEY
REALLY SPOKE CONSISTED MERELY OF FIVE HUNDRED PARLIAMENTARIANS; AND THAT
SAYS ENOUGH.

THE WORST WAS THE FOLLOWING:

THE PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT COULD HOPE FOR SUCCESS ONLY IF THE LEADERS
REALIZED FROM THE VERY FIRST MOMENT THAT HERE THERE WAS NO QUESTION SO
MUCH OF A NEW PARTY AS OF A NEW WELTANSCHAUUNG. THIS ALONE COULD AROUSE
THE INNER MORAL FORCES THAT WERE NECESSARY FOR SUCH A GIGANTIC STRUGGLE.
AND FOR THIS STRUGGLE THE LEADERS MUST BE MEN OF FIRST-CLASS BRAINS AND
INDOMITABLE COURAGE. IF THE STRUGGLE ON BEHALF OF A WELTANSCHAUUNG IS
NOT CONDUCTED BY MEN OF HEROIC SPIRIT WHO ARE READY TO SACRIFICE,
EVERYTHING, WITHIN A SHORT WHILE IT WILL BECOME IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND REAL
FIGHTING FOLLOWERS WHO ARE READY TO LAY DOWN THEIR LIVES FOR THE CAUSE.
A MAN WHO FIGHTS ONLY FOR HIS OWN EXISTENCE HAS NOT MUCH LEFT OVER FOR
THE SERVICE OF THE COMMUNITY.

IN ORDER TO SECURE THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS,
EVERYBODY CONCERNED MUST BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEW MOVEMENT
LOOKS TO POSTERITY FOR ITS HONOUR AND GLORY BUT THAT IT HAS NO
RECOMPENSE TO OFFER TO THE PRESENT-DAY MEMBERS. IF A MOVEMENT SHOULD
OFFER A LARGE NUMBER OF POSITIONS AND OFFICES THAT ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE
THE NUMBER OF UNWORTHY CANDIDATES ADMITTED TO MEMBERSHIP WILL BE
CONSTANTLY ON THE INCREASE AND EVENTUALLY A DAY WILL COME WHEN THERE
WILL BE SUCH A PREPONDERANCE OF POLITICAL PROFITEERS AMONG THE
MEMBERSHIP OF A SUCCESSFUL PARTY THAT THE COMBATANTS WHO BORE THE BRUNT
OF THE BATTLE IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF THE MOVEMENT CAN NOW SCARCELY
RECOGNIZE THEIR OWN PARTY AND MAY BE EJECTED BY THE LATER ARRIVALS AS
UNWANTED BALLAST. THEREWITH THE MOVEMENT WILL NO LONGER HAVE A MISSION
TO FULFIL.

ONCE THE PAN-GERMANISTS DECIDED TO COLLABORATE WITH PARLIAMENT THEY WERE
NO LONGER LEADERS AND COMBATANTS IN A POPULAR MOVEMENT, BUT MERELY
PARLIAMENTARIANS. THUS THE MOVEMENT SANK TO THE COMMON POLITICAL PARTY
LEVEL OF THE DAY AND NO LONGER HAD THE STRENGTH TO FACE A HOSTILE FATE
AND DEFY THE RISK OF MARTYRDOM. INSTEAD OF FIGHTING, THE PAN-GERMAN
LEADERS FELL INTO THE HABIT OF TALKING AND NEGOTIATING. THE NEW
PARLIAMENTARIANS SOON FOUND THAT IT WAS A MORE SATISFACTORY, BECAUSE
LESS RISKY, WAY OF FULFILLING THEIR TASK IF THEY WOULD DEFEND THE NEW
WELTANSCHAUUNG WITH THE SPIRITUAL WEAPON OF PARLIAMENTARY RHETORIC
RATHER THAN TAKE UP A FIGHT IN WHICH THEY PLACED THEIR LIVES IN DANGER,
THE OUTCOME OF WHICH ALSO WAS UNCERTAIN AND EVEN AT THE BEST COULD OFFER
NO PROSPECT OF PERSONAL GAIN FOR THEMSELVES.

WHEN THEY HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS IN PARLIAMENT THEIR ADHERENTS OUTSIDE
HOPED AND WAITED FOR MIRACLES TO HAPPEN. NATURALLY NO SUCH MIRACLES
HAPPENED OR COULD HAPPEN. WHEREUPON THE ADHERENTS OF THE MOVEMENT SOON
GREW IMPATIENT, BECAUSE REPORTS THEY READ ABOUT THEIR OWN DEPUTIES DID
NOT IN THE LEAST COME UP TO WHAT HAD BEEN EXPECTED WHEN THEY VOTED FOR
THESE DEPUTIES AT THE ELECTIONS. THE REASON FOR THIS WAS NOT FAR TO
SEEK. IT WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT AN UNFRIENDLY PRESS REFRAINED FROM
GIVING A TRUE ACCOUNT OF WHAT THE PAN-GERMAN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE
PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY DOING.

ACCORDING AS THE NEW DEPUTIES GOT TO LIKE THIS MILD FORM OF
'REVOLUTIONARY' STRUGGLE IN PARLIAMENT AND IN THE PROVINCIAL DIETS THEY
GRADUALLY BECAME RELUCTANT TO RESUME THE MORE HAZARDOUS WORK OF
EXPOUNDING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE MOVEMENT BEFORE THE BROAD MASSES OF THE
PEOPLE.

MASS MEETINGS IN PUBLIC BECAME MORE AND MORE RARE, THOUGH THESE ARE THE
ONLY MEANS OF EXERCISING A REALLY EFFECTIVE INFLUENCE ON THE PEOPLE;
BECAUSE HERE THE INFLUENCE COMES FROM DIRECT PERSONAL CONTACT AND IN
THIS WAY THE SUPPORT OF LARGE SECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE CAN BE OBTAINED.

WHEN THE TABLES ON WHICH THE SPEAKERS USED TO STAND IN THE GREAT
BEER-HALLS, ADDRESSING AN ASSEMBLY OF THOUSANDS, WERE DESERTED FOR THE
PARLIAMENTARY TRIBUNE AND THE SPEECHES WERE NO LONGER ADDRESSED TO THE
PEOPLE DIRECTLY BUT TO THE SO-CALLED 'CHOSEN' REPRESENTATIVES, THE
PAN-GERMAN MOVEMENT LOST ITS POPULAR CHARACTER AND IN A LITTLE WHILE
DEGENERATED TO THE LEVEL OF A MORE OR LESS SERIOUS CLUB WHERE PROBLEMS
OF THE DAY ARE DISCUSSED ACADEMICALLY.

THE WRONG IMPRESSION CREATED BY THE PRESS WAS NO LONGER CORRECTED BY
PERSONAL CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE THROUGH PUBLIC MEETINGS, WHEREBY THE
INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTATIVES MIGHT HAVE GIVEN A TRUE ACCOUNT OF THEIR
ACTIVITIES. THE FINAL RESULT OF THIS NEGLECT WAS THAT THE WORD
'PAN-GERMAN' CAME TO HAVE AN UNPLEASANT SOUND IN THE EARS OF THE MASSES.

THE KNIGHTS OF THE PEN AND THE LITERARY SNOBS OF TO-DAY SHOULD BE MADE
TO REALIZE THAT THE GREAT TRANSFORMATIONS WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THIS
WORLD WERE NEVER CONDUCTED BY A GOOSEQUILL. NO. THE TASK OF THE PEN MUST
ALWAYS BE THAT OF PRESENTING THE THEORETICAL CONCEPTS WHICH MOTIVATE
SUCH CHANGES. THE FORCE WHICH HAS EVER AND ALWAYS SET IN MOTION GREAT
HISTORICAL AVALANCHES OF RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IS THE MAGIC
POWER OF THE SPOKEN WORD.

THE BROAD MASSES OF A POPULATION ARE MORE AMENABLE TO THE APPEAL OF
RHETORIC THAN TO ANY OTHER FORCE. ALL GREAT MOVEMENTS ARE POPULAR
MOVEMENTS. THEY ARE THE VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS OF HUMAN PASSIONS AND
EMOTIONS, STIRRED INTO ACTIVITY BY THE RUTHLESS GODDESS OF DISTRESS OR
BY THE TORCH OF THE SPOKEN WORD CAST INTO THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLE. IN NO
CASE HAVE GREAT MOVEMENTS BEEN SET AFOOT BY THE SYRUPY EFFUSIONS OF
AESTHETIC LITTÃ©RATEURS AND DRAWING-ROOM HEROES.

THE DOOM OF A NATION CAN BE AVERTED ONLY BY A STORM OF GLOWING PASSION;
BUT ONLY THOSE WHO ARE PASSIONATE THEMSELVES CAN AROUSE PASSION IN
OTHERS. IT IS ONLY THROUGH THE CAPACITY FOR PASSIONATE FEELING THAT
CHOSEN LEADERS CAN WIELD THE POWER OF THE WORD WHICH, LIKE HAMMER BLOWS,
WILL OPEN THE DOOR TO THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE.

HE WHO IS NOT CAPABLE OF PASSIONATE FEELING AND SPEECH WAS NEVER CHOSEN
BY PROVIDENCE TO BE THE HERALD OF ITS WILL. THEREFORE A WRITER SHOULD
STICK TO HIS INK-BOTTLE AND BUSY HIMSELF WITH THEORETICAL QUESTIONS IF
HE HAS THE REQUISITE ABILITY AND KNOWLEDGE. HE HAS NOT BEEN BORN OR
CHOSEN TO BE A LEADER.

A MOVEMENT WHICH HAS GREAT ENDS TO ACHIEVE MUST CAREFULLY GUARD AGAINST
THE DANGER OF LOSING CONTACT WITH THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE. EVERY
PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED MUST BE EXAMINED FROM THIS VIEWPOINT FIRST OF ALL
AND THE DECISION TO BE MADE MUST ALWAYS BE IN HARMONY WITH THIS
PRINCIPLE.
